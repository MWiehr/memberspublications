Plan:
1. Import the better bibtex file
```{r}
install.packages("RefManageR")
library(RefManageR)
bib_file <- ReadBib("LMUOpenScienceCenter_MembersPublications.bib")
```

2. Filter For "Tags" #keyword = "m_true" OR "g_true" #papers perceived as meeting the criteria that the raters m or g deemed fitting
3. Use that list to make a references list
