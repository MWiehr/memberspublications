      "title": "Attitudes Toward Open Science and Public Data Sharing A Survey Among Members of the German Psychological Society",
      "abstractNote": "Central values of science are, among others, transparency, verifiability, replicability, and openness. The currently very prominent Open Science (OS) movement supports these values. Among its most important principles are open methodology (comprehensive and useful documentation of methods and materials used), open access to published research output, and open data (making collected data available for re-analyses). We here present a survey conducted among members of the German Psychological Society (N = 337), in which we applied a mixed-methods approach (quantitative and qualitative data) to assess attitudes toward OS in general and toward data sharing more specifically. Attitudes toward OS were distinguished into positive expectations (\"hopes\") and negative expectations (\"fears\"). These were uncorrelated. There were generally more hopes associated with OS and data sharing than fears. Both hopes and fears were highest among early career researchers and lowest among professors. The analysis of the open answers revealed that generally positive attitudes toward data sharing (especially sharing of data related to a published article) are somewhat diminished by cost/benefit considerations. The results are discussed with respect to individual researchers' behavior and with respect to structural changes in the research system.",

      "title": "Patients with COVID-19: in the dark-NETs of neutrophils",
      "abstractNote": "SARS-CoV-2 infection poses a major threat to the lungs and multiple other organs, occasionally causing death. Until effective vaccines are developed to curb the pandemic, it is paramount to define the mechanisms and develop protective therapies to prevent organ dysfunction in patients with COVID-19. Individuals that develop severe manifestations have signs of dysregulated innate and adaptive immune responses. Emerging evidence implicates neutrophils and the disbalance between neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation and degradation plays a central role in the pathophysiology of inflammation, coagulopathy, organ damage, and immunothrombosis that characterize severe cases of COVID-19. Here, we discuss the evidence supporting a role for NETs in COVID-19 manifestations and present putative mechanisms, by which NETs promote tissue injury and immunothrombosis. We present therapeutic strategies, which have been successful in the treatment of immun omicron-inflammatory disorders and which target dysregulated NET formation or degradation, as potential approaches that may benefit patients with severe COVID-19.",

      "abstractNote": "Science should be self-correcting. However, researchers often hesitate to admit errors and to adopt reforms in their own work. In two studies (overall N = 702), we test whether scientific self-criticism and reform intentions expressed by researchers damage or rather improve their reputation in the eyes of the public (i.e. perceivers). Across both studies, such self-correction (compared to no self-correction) increases perceivers' epistemic trustworthiness ascriptions, credibility perceptions, and willingness to further engage with science. Study 2 revealed that these effects were largely driven by the no self-criticism condition. In addition, researchers' commitment to implementing reforms had positive effects and rejecting reforms had negative effects on perceptions, irrespective of the extent of these reforms. These findings suggest that researchers' fear that self-criticism and expressing reform intentions may damage their reputation may be unfounded.",

      "abstractNote": "War photography is not only used illustratively in news media but also displayed as controversial art objects. The ethics and impact of aestheticization in war photography have long been debated. In three studies (N-1 = 243, N-2 = 251, N-3 = 254), we contribute empirically to this debate by testing the impact of aesthetics in war photography (i.e., aesthetic style and context) on emotionalization and behavioral activation. While viewing war photography was, overall, emotionalizing (especially regarding negative affect and moral outrage), we did not find any behavioral activation (i.e., donation intention and behavior or general willingness to act against war). Neither aesthetic style nor aesthetic context made a difference in affective or behavioral responses. However, a salient aesthetic context (Study 3) led to higher aesthetic judgments of war photographs. Overall, these results question whether aesthetics in war photography have a particular power for evoking emotional and behavioral responses.",

      "abstractNote": "Science is unthinkable without collaboration between scientists. Yet, science is also unthinkable without competition (i.e., competing for the best and most solid arguments and limited, precious resources). In this review, we argue that scientific work routines represent social dilemmas and that two facets of prosociality help researchers solve these dilemmas: (i) sacrificing personal profit for the sake of collective profit (i.e., cooperation) and (ii) deciding to make oneself vulnerable to exploitation (i.e., trust). We use two contemporary developments in science to illustrate our reasoning: First, researchers' willingness to engage with the lay public (e.g., investing one's limited time to public engagement) and second, their commitment to 'open science' (e.g., sharing one's data and materials despite the risk of exploitation).",

      "abstractNote": "Research is often fueled by researchers' scientific, but also their personal interests: Sometimes, researchers decide to pursue a specific research question because the answer to that question is idiosyncratically relevant for themselves: Such \"me-search\" may not only affect the quality of research, but also how it is perceived by the general public. In two studies (N = 621), we investigate the circumstances under which learning about a researcher's \"me-search\" increases or decreases laypeople's ascriptions of trustworthiness and credibility to the respective researcher. Results suggest that participants' own preexisting attitudes towards the research topic moderate the effects of \"me-search\" substantially: When participants hold favorable attitudes towards the research topic (i.e., LGBTQ or veganism), \"me-searchers\" were perceived as more trustworthy and their research was perceived as more credible. This pattern was reversed when participants held unfavorable attitudes towards the research topic. Study 2 furthermore shows that trustworthiness and credibility perceptions generalize to evaluations of the entire field of research. Implications for future research and practice are discussed.",

      "title": "Asymptomatic hyperuricaemia in chronic kidney disease: mechanisms and clinical implications",
      "abstractNote": "Asymptomatic hyperuricaemia (HU) is considered a pathogenic factor in multiple disease contexts, but a causative role is only proven for the crystalline form of uric acid in gouty arthritis and urate nephropathy. Epidemiological studies document a robust association of HU with hypertension, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and CKD progression, but CKD-related impaired uric acid (UA) clearance and the use of diuretics that further impair UA clearance likely accounts for these associations. Interpreting the available trial evidence is further complicated by referring to xanthine oxidase inhibitors as urate-lowering treatment, although these drugs inhibit other substrates, so attributing their effects only to HU is problematic. In this review we provide new mechanistic insights into the biological effects of soluble and crystalline UA and discuss clinical evidence on the role of asymptomatic HU in CKD, CVD and sterile inflammation. We identify research areas with gaps in experimental and clinical evidence, specifically on infectious complications that represent the second common cause of death in CKD patients, referred to as secondary immunodeficiency related to kidney disease. In addition, we address potential therapeutic approaches on how and when to treat asymptomatic HU in patients with kidney disease and where further interventional studies are required.\nLay Summary Asymptomatic hyperuricaemia (HU) has a documented causative role in gouty arthritis, kidney stones and urate nephropathy, disorders that are attributed to uric acid (UA) in its crystalline form and are characterized by the pro-inflammatory effects of UA crystals. In contrast, soluble UA/HU has been associated with hypertension, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD), but a causative link has not been secured. Recent experimental data indicate that soluble UA/asymptomatic HU acts as a suppressor of innate immunity. Thus soluble and crystalline UA seem to have opposite effects. In this review we highlight new mechanistic insights on the effects of soluble versus crystalline UA and provide clinical evidence on the role of asymptomatic HU in CKD, CVD and the secondary immunodeficiency in host defence and sterile inflammation. Additionally, we provide potential therapeutic approaches on when and how to treat asymptomatic HU in patients with kidney disease.",

      "abstractNote": "The management of immunoglobulin A nephropathy, membranous nephropathy, lupus nephritis, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis, C3 glomerulonephritis, autoimmune podocytopathies and other immune-mediated glomerular disorders is focused on two major treatment goals, preventing overall mortality and the loss of kidney function. Since minimizing irreversible kidney damage best serves both goals, the management of immune-mediated kidney disorders must focus on the two central pathomechanisms of kidney function decline, i.e., controlling the underlying immune disease process (e.g. with immunotherapies) and controlling the non-immune mechanisms of chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression. Here we review the pathophysiology of these non-immune mechanisms of CKD progression and discuss non-drug and drug interventions to attenuate CKD progression in immune-mediated kidney disorders. Non-pharmacological interventions include reducing salt intake, normalizing body weight, avoiding superimposed kidney injuries, smoking cessation and regular physical activity. Approved drug interventions include inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2. Numerous additional drugs to improve CKD care are currently being tested in clinical trials. Here we discuss how and when to use these drugs in the different clinical scenarios of immune-mediated kidney diseases.",

      "abstractNote": "'Glomerulonephritis' (GN) is a term used to describe a group of heterogeneous immune-mediated disorders characterized by inflammation of the filtration units of the kidney (the glomeruli). These disorders are currently classified largely on the basis of histopathological lesion patterns, but these patterns do not align well with their diverse pathological mechanisms and hence do not inform optimal therapy. Instead, we propose grouping GN disorders into five categories according to their immunopathogenesis: infection-related GN, autoimmune GN, alloimmune GN, autoinflammatory GN and monoclonal gammopathy-related GN. This categorization can inform the appropriate treatment; for example, infection control for infection-related GN, suppression of adaptive immunity for autoimmune GN and alloimmune GN, inhibition of single cytokines or complement factors for autoinflammatory GN arising from inborn errors in innate immunity, and plasma cell clone-directed or B cell clone-directed therapy for monoclonal gammopathies. Here we present the immunopathogenesis of GN and immunotherapies in use and in development and discuss how an immunopathogenesis-based GN classification can focus research, and improve patient management and teaching.",

      "abstractNote": "Lupus nephritis is an inflammation of the kidneys caused by the autoimmune disease systemic lupus erythematosus. This Primer reviews the epidemiology of lupus nephritis, its pathogenesis and advances in its treatment.\nLupus nephritis (LN) is a form of glomerulonephritis that constitutes one of the most severe organ manifestations of the autoimmune disease systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Most patients with SLE who develop LN do so within 5 years of an SLE diagnosis and, in many cases, LN is the presenting manifestation resulting in the diagnosis of SLE. Understanding of the genetic and pathogenetic basis of LN has improved substantially over the past few decades. Treatment of LN usually involves immunosuppressive therapy, typically with mycophenolate mofetil or cyclophosphamide and with glucocorticoids, although these treatments are not uniformly effective. Despite increased knowledge of disease pathogenesis and improved treatment options, LN remains a substantial cause of morbidity and death among patients with SLE. Within 10 years of an initial SLE diagnosis, 5-20% of patients with LN develop end-stage kidney disease, and the multiple comorbidities associated with immunosuppressive treatment, including infections, osteoporosis and cardiovascular and reproductive effects, remain a concern. Clearly, early and accurate diagnosis of LN and prompt initiation of therapy are of vital importance to improve outcomes in patients with SLE.",

      "abstractNote": "In 2019 and 2021, the European League for Rheumatism (EULAR) jointly with the European Renal Association (ERA) and the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO), respectively, released updated guidelines on the management of lupus nephritis (LN). The Immunology Working Group of the ERA reviewed and compared both updates. Recommendations were either consistent or differences were of negligible clinical relevance for: indication for kidney biopsy, kidney biopsy interpretation, treatment targets, hydroxychloroquine dosing, first-line initial immunosuppressive therapy for active class III, IV (+/- V) LN, pregnancy in LN, LN in paediatric patients and LN patients with kidney failure. Relevant differences in the recommended management relate to the recognition of lupus podocytopathies, uncertainties in steroid dosing, drug preferences in specific populations and maintenance therapy, treatment of pure class V LN, therapy of recurrent LN, evolving alternative drug options and diagnostic work-up of thrombotic microangiopathy. Altogether, both documents provide an excellent guidance to the growing complexity of LN management. This article endeavours to prevent confusion by identifying differences and clarifying discrepancies.",

The immune system plays a central role during acute kidney injury (AKI), adapting evolutional systems programmed for host defence and minimizing unnecessary collateral damage. Indeed, depending upon the disease context, the impact of the immune system upon the manifestations and consequences of AKI can be quite different. Here we provide an overview of the known and unknown involvement of the immune system within the wide range of different forms of AKI, to oppose oversimplification and to endorse deeper insights into the pathogenesis of the different diseases causing kidney injury. This approach may help to overcome some of the current hurdles in translational AKI research and the development of specific treatments for the different diseases, all presenting with an acute increase in serum creatinine or decline in urinary output. One concept does not fit all.",

      "title": "Recommendations for the management of patients with immune-mediated kidney disease during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic",
      "abstractNote": "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has created major challenges for all countries around the globe. Retrospective studies have identified hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and older age as risk factors for high morbidity and mortality from COVID-19. There is a general concern that patients with immune-mediated kidney diseases, namely those on immunosuppressive therapies and/or those with more advanced kidney failure, could particularly be at risk for adverse outcomes due to a compromised antiviral immunity. Uncertainties exist on how management routines should be reorganized to minimize the risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection and what measures are necessary for infected patients. The aim of the present review of the Immunonephrology Working Group of the European Renal Association-European Dialysis and Transplant Association is to provide recommendations for the management of patients with immune-mediated kidney diseases based on the available evidence, similar circumstances with other infectious organisms and expert opinions from across Europe. Such recommendations may help to minimize the risk of encountering COVID-19 or developing complications during COVID-19 in patients with immune-mediated kidney disease.",

      "title": "SGLT2 inhibition requires reconsideration of fundamental paradigms in chronic kidney disease, 'diabetic nephropathy', IgA nephropathy and podocytopathies with FSGS lesions",
      "abstractNote": "In 2020, the Dapagliflozin and Prevention of Adverse Outcomes in Chronic Kidney Disease (DAPA-CKD) trial first demonstrated that inhibition of the sodium-glucose transporter-2 (SGLT2) with dapagliflozin attenuates the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) with proteinuria in patients with or without diabetes at an unprecedented effect size. These results have far-reaching implications for a series of traditional concepts in Nephrology. It now became obvious that CKD with and without diabetes involves a predominant SGLT2-driven pathophysiology compared with the other pathogenic pathways currently under consideration. As SGLT2 inhibition is similarly efficacious in diabetic and non-diabetic CKD with proteinuria, treating CKD rather than 'diabetic nephropathy' becomes the central paradigm. Indeed, in older adults with type 2 diabetes, CKD is rather of multifactorial origin. As the DAPA-CKD trial included more patients with immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) than any of the previous IgAN trials, dual renin-angiotensin/SGLT2 inhibition may become the new standard. The same applies for patients with podocytopathy-related focal segmental glomerulosclerosis lesions. From now on, IgAN and podocytopathy trials without SGLT2 inhibition as background therapy and without glomerular filtration rate decline as primary outcome criterion will be of limited value. These and other potential implications will trigger broad discussions and secondary research activities with conclusions difficult to predict today. However, one is for sure: Nephrology after the DAPA-CKD trial will be not the same as it was before. Finally!",

      "title": "The glomerular crescent: triggers, evolution, resolution, and implications for therapy",
      "abstractNote": "Purpose of review\nCrescents are classical histopathological lesions found in severe forms of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, also referred to as crescentic glomerulonephritis (CGN). Crescent formation is a consequence of diverse upstream pathomechanisms and unraveling these mechanisms is of great interest for improving the management of patients affected by CGN. Thus, in this review, we provide an update on the latest insight into the understanding on how crescents develop and how they resolve.\nRecent findings\nCellular crescents develop from activated parietal epithelial cells (PECs) residing along Bowman's capsule and their formation has as a consequence the decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Cellular crescents can be reversible, but when multilevel growth of PECs associate with an epithelial--mesenchymal transition-like change in cell phenotype, fibrous crescents form, and crescents become irreversible also in terms of GFR recovery. Different molecular pathways trigger the activation of PECs and are a prime therapeutics target in CGN. First, crescent formation requires also vascular injury causing ruptures in the glomerular basement membrane that trigger plasmatic coagulation within Bowman's space. This vascular necrosis can be triggered by different upstream mechanisms, such as small vessel vasculitides, immune complex glomerulonephritis, anti-GBM disease, and C3 glomerulonephritis, that all share complement activation but involve diverse upstream immune mechanisms outside the kidney accessible for therapeutic intervention.\nKnowing the upstream mechanisms that triggered crescent formation provides a tool for the development of therapeutic interventions for CGN.",

      "abstractNote": "Discrimination is long seen as a meaningful factor for ethnic inequalities on rental housing markets. Yet empirically, the extent of discrimination is still debatable. For the first time, this article provides a quantitative meta-analysis of field experiments (in person audits and correspondence tests) that were run over the last four decades in the United States, Canada and Europe (N = 71). Special focus is given to a possible inflation of effect sizes by publication bias; to time trends; and to evidence for statistical discrimination. Taken together, nearly all experiments document the occurrence of ethnic discrimination. Effect sizes are inflated by publication bias, but there is still substantial evidence left once the bias is removed. The analysis reveals a consistent decline in the extent of discrimination over time, from moderate levels of discrimination in the 1970s and 1980s, up to only small but still statistically significant levels in the 1990s and 2000s. A significant part of the discriminatory behaviour can be attributed to missing information about the social status of applicants, which supports theories on statistical discrimination. It is discussed how future research could move our knowledge on the underlying mechanisms forward.",

      "title": "Different samples, different results? How sampling techniques affect the results of field experiments on ethnic discrimination",
      "abstractNote": "This paper explores a possible sampling bias in field experiments through a unique combination of a large-scale field experiment on ethnic discrimination in the German rental housing market (N= 2,992 tested apartments) and data on the internet housing market where the apartments were sampled from (observation of the whole platform for about one year). Up to now, most field experiments sampled on the level of suppliers (not apartments) and selected the tested suppliers within a short field period (point sampling). This probably led to an over-representation of small suppliers and apartments that had already been advertised for a long time, resulting in an under-representation of large suppliers and new vacancies. We analyze how both issues affect the measurement of ethnic discrimination and its underlying mechanisms. With our case study on the German housing market, we first observed the expected sampling bias: There was a strong over-sampling of small suppliers and apartments already offered for a long time. Second, this bias was found to have only little impact on the descriptive result of substantial discrimination against Turkish applicants. There was only a slight tendency that discrimination was higher for small suppliers and offers advertised for a relatively short time (i.e. new vacancies). Overall, we conclude that evidence on ethnic discrimination and its underlying risk factors is remarkably robust to the used sampling technique. Although there were no indications of a severe bias, our market data illustrate opportunities to test the effects of market conditions that often remained unnoticed.",

      "title": "Does Immigration Reduce the Support for Welfare Spending? A Cautionary Tale on Spatial Panel Data Analysis",
      "abstractNote": "There has been a long-lasting debate over whether increasing ethnic diversity undermines support for social welfare, and whether this conflict thesis applies not only to the United States, but also to European welfare states. In their 2016 ASR article, Schmidt-Catran and Spies analyzed a panel (1994 to 2010) of regional units in Germany and concluded that this thesis also holds for Germany. We argue that their analysis suffers from misspecification: their model specification assumes parallel time trends in welfare support in all German regions. However, time trends strongly differed between Western and Eastern Germany after reunification. In the 1990s, Eastern Germans' attitudes adapted to a less interventionist Western welfare system (\"Goodbye Lenin effect\"). When allowing for heterogeneous time trends, we find no evidence that increasing proportions of foreigners undermine welfare support, or that this association is moderated by economic hardship (high unemployment rates). We conclude with some general suggestions regarding the conceptualization of context effects in spatial analyses.",

      "abstractNote": "In 2018, Silberzahn, Uhlmann, Nosek, and colleagues published an article in which 29 teams analyzed the same research question with the same data: Are soccer referees more likely to give red cards to players with dark skin tone than light skin tone? The results obtained by the teams differed extensively. Many concluded from this widely noted exercise that the social sciences are not rigorous enough to provide definitive answers. In this article, we investigate why results diverged so much. We argue that the main reason was an unclear research question: Teams differed in their interpretation of the research question and therefore used diverse research designs and model specifications. We show by reanalyzing the data that with a clear research question, a precise definition of the parameter of interest, and theory-guided causal reasoning, results vary only within a narrow range. The broad conclusion of our reanalysis is that social science research needs to be more precise in its \"estimands\" to become credible.",

      "abstractNote": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major public health concern, affecting approximately 10% of the population worldwide. CKD of glomerular or tubular origin leads to the activation of stress mechanisms, including the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) activation. Over the last two decades, blockade of the MR has arisen as a potential therapeutic approach against various forms of kidney disease. In this review, we summarize the experimental studies that have shown a protective effect of MR antagonists (MRAs) in nondiabetic and diabetic CKD animal models. Moreover, we review the main clinical trials that have shown the clinical application of MRAs to reduce albuminuria and, importantly, to slow CKD progression. Recent evidence from the FIDELIO trial showed that the MRA finerenone can reduce hard kidney outcomes when added to the standard of care in CKD associated with type 2 diabetes. Finally, we discuss the effects of MRAs relative to those of SGLT2 inhibitors, as well as the potential benefit of combination therapy to maximize organ protection.",

      "abstractNote": "Background Whole-exome sequencing (WES) increases the diagnostic rate of genetic kidney disorders, but accessibility, interpretation of results, and costs limit use in daily practice.Methods Univariable analysis of a historical cohort of 392 patients who underwent WES for kidney diseases showed that resistance to treatments, familial history of kidney disease, extrarenal involvement, congenital abnormalities of the kidney and urinary tract and CKD stage $G2, two or more cysts per kidney on ultrasound, persistent hyper echoic kidneys or nephrocalcinosis on ultrasound, and persistent metabolic abnormalities were most predictive for genetic diagnosis. We prospectively applied these criteria to select patients in a network of nephrology centers, followed by centralized genetic diagnosis by WES, reverse phenotyping, and multidisciplinary board discussion.Results We applied this multistep workflow to 476 patients with eight clinical categories (podocytopathies, collagenopathies, CKD of unknown origin, tubulopathies, ciliopathies, congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract, syndromic CKD, metabolic kidney disorders), obtaining genetic diagnosis for 319 of 476 patients (67.0%) (95% in 21 patients with disease onset during the fetal period or at birth, 64% in 298 pediatric patients, and 70% in 156 adult patients). The suspected clinical diagnosis was confirmed in 48% of the 476 patients and modified in 19%. A modeled cost analysis showed that application of this workflow saved 20% of costs per patient when performed at the beginning of the diagnostic process. Real cost analysis of 66 patients randomly selected from all categories showed actual cost reduction of 41%. Conclusions A diagnostic workflow for genetic kidney diseases that includes WES is cost-saving, especially if implemented early, and is feasible in a real-world setting.",

      "abstractNote": "Most machine learning algorithms are configured by a set of hyperparameters whose values must be carefully chosen and which often considerably impact performance. To avoid a time-consuming and irreproducible manual process of trial-and-error to find well-performing hyperparameter configurations, various automatic hyperparameter optimization (HPO) methods-for example, based on resampling error estimation for supervised machine learning-can be employed. After introducing HPO from a general perspective, this paper reviews important HPO methods, from simple techniques such as grid or random search to more advanced methods like evolution strategies, Bayesian optimization, Hyperband, and racing. This work gives practical recommendations regarding important choices to be made when conducting HPO, including the HPO algorithms themselves, performance evaluation, how to combine HPO with machine learning pipelines, runtime improvements, and parallelization.This article is categorized under:Algorithmic Development > StatisticsTechnologies > Machine LearningTechnologies > Prediction",

      "title": "Demonstration of a 'leapfrog' randomized controlled trial as a method to accelerate the development and optimization of psychological interventions",
      "abstractNote": "Background The scale of the global mental health burden indicates the inadequacy not only of current treatment options, but also the pace of the standard treatment development process. The 'leapfrog' trial design is a newly-developed simple Bayesian adaptive trial design with potential to accelerate treatment development. A first leapfrog trial was conducted to provide a demonstration and test feasibility, applying the method to a low-intensity internet-delivered intervention targeting anhedonia. Methods At the start of this online, single-blind leapfrog trial, participants self-reporting depression were randomized to an initial control arm comprising four weeks of weekly questionnaires, or one of two versions of a four-week cognitive training intervention, imagery cognitive bias modification (imagery CBM). Intervention arms were compared to control on an ongoing basis via sequential Bayesian analyses, based on a primary outcome of anhedonia at post-intervention. Results were used to eliminate and replace arms, or to promote them to become the control condition based on pre-specified Bayes factor and sample size thresholds. Two further intervention arms (variants of imagery CBM) were added into the trial as it progressed. Results N = 188 participants were randomized across the five trial arms. The leapfrog methodology was successfully implemented to identify a 'winning' version of the imagery CBM, i.e. the version most successful in reducing anhedonia, following sequential elimination of the other arms. Conclusions The study demonstrates feasibility of the leapfrog design and provides a foundation for its adoption as a method to accelerate treatment development in mental health.

      "abstractNote": "The application of basic science research to the development and optimization of psychological treatments holds great potential. However, this process of clinical translation is challenging and time-consuming, and the standard route by which it proceeds is inefficient. Adaptive rolling designs, which originated within cancer treatment research, provide an alternative methodology with potential to accelerate development and optimization of psychological treatments. In such designs, multiple treatment options are tested simultaneously, with sequential Bayesian analyses used to remove poorly performing arms. Further, new treatment arms informed by the latest research findings can be introduced into the existing infrastructure as the trial progresses. These features dramatically reduce the sample sizes needed and offer a means for more rapid and efficient clinical translation. This article outlines the utility of such designs to clinical psychological science, focusing on a new variant termed the leapfrog design, and discusses their potential uses to accelerate clinical translation.",

      "abstractNote": "Background: Pseudoprogression (PsP) or radiation necrosis (RN) may frequently occur after cranial radiotherapy and show a similar imaging pattern compared with progressive disease (PD). We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging-based contrast clearance analysis (CCA) in this clinical setting.\nPatients and methods: Patients with equivocal imaging findings after cranial radiotherapy were consecutively included into this monocentric prospective study. CCA was carried out by software-based automated subtraction of imaging features in late versus early T1-weighted sequences after contrast agent application. Two experienced neuroradiologists evaluated CCA with respect to PsP/RN and PD being blinded for histological findings. The radiological assessment was compared with the histopathological results, and its accuracy was calculated statistically.\nResults: A total of 33 patients were included; 16 (48.5%) were treated because of a primary brain tumor (BT), and 17 (51.1%) because of a secondary BT. In one patient, CCA was technically infeasible. The accuracy of CCA in predicting the histological result was 0.84 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.67-0.95; one-sided P = 0.051; n = 32]. Sensitivity and specificity of CCA were 0.93 (95% CI 0.66-1.00) and 0.78 (95% CI 0.52-0.94), respectively. The accuracy in patients with secondary BTs was 0.94 (95% CI 0.71-1.00) and nonsignificantly higher compared with patients with primary BT with an accuracy of 0.73 (95% CI 0.45-0.92), P = 0.16.\nConclusions: In this study, CCA was a highly accurate, easy, and helpful method for distinguishing PsP or RN from PD after cranial radiotherapy, especially in patients with secondary tumors after radiosurgical treatment.",

      "abstractNote": "Background and Purpose: There is no randomized evidence comparing whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) in the treatment of multiple brain metastases. This prospective nonrandomized controlled single arm trial attempts to reduce the gap until prospective randomized controlled trial results are available.Material and Methods: We included patients with 4-10 brain metastases and ECOG performance status & LE; 2 from all histologies except small-cell lung cancer, germ cell tumors, and lymphoma. The retrospective WBRT-cohort was selected 2:1 from consecutive patients treated within 2012-2017. Propensity-score matching was performed to adjust for confounding factors such as sex, age, primary tumor histology, dsGPA score, and systemic therapy. SRS was performed using a LINAC-based single-isocenter technique employing prescription doses from 15-20Gyx1 at the 80% isodose line. The historical control consisted of equivalent WBRT dose regimens of either 3Gyx10 or 2.5Gyx14.Results: Patients were recruited from 2017-2020, end of follow-up was July 1st, 2021.40 patients were recruited to the SRS-cohort and 70 patients were eligible as controls in the WBRT-cohort. Median OS, and iPFS were 10.4 months (95%-CI 9.3-NA) and 7.1 months (95%-CI 3.9-14.2) for the SRS-cohort, and 6.5 months (95%-CI 4.9-10.4), and 5.9 months (95%-CI 4.1-8.8) for the WBRT-cohort, respectively. Differences were non-significant for OS (HR: 0.65; 95%-CI 0.40-1.05; P =.074) and iPFS (P =.28). No grade III toxicities were observed in the SRS-cohort.Conclusion: This trial did not meet its primary endpoint as the OS-improvement of SRS compared to WBRT was non-significant and thus superiority could not be proven. Prospective randomized trials in the era of immunotherapy and targeted therapies are warranted.& COPY; 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

      "abstractNote": "Since the discovery and definition of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) 14 years ago, numerous characteristics and physiological functions of NETs have been uncovered. Nowadays, the field continues to expand and novel mechanisms that orchestrate formation of NETs, their previously unknown properties, and novel implications in disease continue to emerge. The abundance of available data has also led to some confusion in the NET research community due to contradictory results and divergent scientific concepts, such as pro- and anti-inflammatory roles in pathologic conditions, demarcation from other forms of cell death, or the origin of the DNA that forms the NET scaffold. Here, we present prevailing concepts and state of the science in NET-related research and elaborate on open questions and areas of dispute.",

      "title": "Introduction to statistical simulations in health research",
      "abstractNote": "In health research, statistical methods are frequently used to address a wide variety of research questions. For almost every analytical challenge, different methods are available. But how do we choose between different methods and how do we judge whether the chosen method is appropriate for our specific study? Like in any science, in statistics, experiments can be run to find out which methods should be used under which circumstances. The main objective of this paper is to demonstrate that simulation studies, that is, experiments investigating synthetic data with known properties, are an invaluable tool for addressing these questions. We aim to provide a first introduction to simulation studies for data analysts or, more generally, for researchers involved at different levels in the analyses of health data, who (1) may rely on simulation studies published in statistical literature to choose their statistical methods and who, thus, need to understand the criteria of assessing the validity and relevance of simulation results and their interpretation; and/or (2) need to understand the basic principles of designing statistical simulations in order to efficiently collaborate with more experienced colleagues or start learning to conduct their own simulations. We illustrate the implementation of a simulation study and the interpretation of its results through a simple example inspired by recent literature, which is completely reproducible using the R-script available from online supplemental file 1.",

      "title": "Making complex prediction rules applicable for readers: Current practice in random forest literature and recommendations",
      "abstractNote": "Ideally, prediction rules should be published in such a way that readers may apply them, for example, to make predictions for their own data. While this is straightforward for simple prediction rules, such as those based on the logistic regression model, this is much more difficult for complex prediction rules derived by machine learning tools. We conducted a survey of articles reporting prediction rules that were constructed using the random forest algorithm and published in PLOS ONE in 2014-2015 in the field \"medical and health sciences\", with the aim of identifying issues related to their applicability. Making a prediction rule reproducible is a possible way to ensure that it is applicable; thus reproducibility is also examined in our survey. The presented prediction rules were applicable in only 2 of 30 identified papers, while for further eight prediction rules it was possible to obtain the necessary information by contacting the authors. Various problems, such as nonresponse of the authors, hampered the applicability of prediction rules in the other cases. Based on our experiences from this illustrative survey, we formulate a set of recommendations for authors who aim to make complex prediction rules applicable for readers. All data including the description of the considered studies and analysis codes are available as supplementary materials.",

The focus is set on regression models and machine learning algorithms taking genetic variables as input and returning a classification or a prediction for the target variable of interest; for example, the present or future disease status, or the future course of a disease. After briefly explaining the basic motivation and principle of these methods, we review different procedures that can be used to evaluate the accuracy of the obtained models and discuss common flaws that may lead to over-optimistic conclusions with respect to their prediction performance and usefulness.",

      "abstractNote": "Although platelets are critically involved in thrombosis and hemostasis, experimental and clinical evidence indicate that platelets promote tumor progression and metastasis through a wide range of physical and functional interactions between platelets and cancer cells. Thrombotic and thromboembolic events are frequent complications in patients with solid tumors. Hence, cancer modulates platelet function by directly inducing platelet-tumor aggregates and triggering platelet granule release and altering platelet turnover. Also, platelets enhance tumor cell dissemination by activating endothelial cell function and recruiting immune cells to primary and metastatic tumor sites. In this review, we summarize current knowledge on the complex interactions between platelets and tumor cells and the host microenvironment. We also critically discuss the potential of anti-platelet agents for cancer prevention and treatment.",

      "title": "Replacing academic journals",
      "abstractNote": "Replacing traditional journals with a more modern solution is not a new idea. Here, we propose ways to overcome the social dilemma underlying the decades of inaction. Any solution needs to not only resolve the current problems but also be capable of preventing takeover by corporations: it needs to replace traditional journals with a decentralized, resilient, evolvable network that is interconnected by open standards and open-source norms under the governance of the scholarly community. It needs to replace the monopolies connected to journals with a genuine, functioning and well-regulated market. In this new market, substitutable service providers compete and innovate according to the conditions of the scholarly community, avoiding sustained vendor lock-in. Therefore, a standards body needs to form under the governance of the scholarly community to allow the development of open scholarly infrastructures servicing the entire research workflow. We propose a redirection of money from legacy publishers to the new network by funding bodies broadening their minimal infrastructure requirements at recipient institutions to include modern infrastructure components replacing and complementing journal functionalities. Such updated eligibility criteria by funding agencies would help realign the financial incentives for recipient institutions with public and scholarly interest.",

      "abstractNote": "Although T cells can exert potent anti-tumor immunity, a subset of T helper (Th) cells producing interleukin-22 (IL-22) in breast and lung tumors is linked to dismal patient outcome. Here, we examined the mechanisms whereby these T cells contribute to disease. In murine models of lung and breast cancer, constitutional and T cell-specific deletion of Il22 reduced metastases without affecting primary tumor growth. Deletion of the IL-22 receptor on cancer cells decreases metastasis to a degree similar to that seen in IL-22-deficient mice. IL-22 induced high expression of CD155, which bound to the activating receptor CD226 on NK cells. Excessive activation led to decreased amounts of CD226 and functionally impaired NK cells, which elevated the metastatic burden. IL-22 signaling was also associated with CD155 expression in human datasets and with poor patient outcomes. Taken together, our findings reveal an immunosuppressive circuit activated by T cell-derived IL-22 that promotes lung metastasis.",

Our manuscript discusses and illustrates consequences of the optimistic bias occurring during the evaluation of novel data analysis methods, that is, all biases resulting from, for example, selection of datasets or competing methods, better ability to fix bugs in a preferred method, and selective reporting of method variants. We quantitatively investigate this bias using an example from epigenetic analysis: normalization methods for data generated by the Illumina HumanMethylation450K BeadChip microarray.",

      "abstractNote": "Objective: It has been suggested that desaturations and bradycardia precede acute life-threatening events (ALTE) and that ALTE is more common in the delivery room than later in life. However, frequency, duration and severity of desaturations in the first hours of life and additional risk factors have not readily been studied. Methods: Term neonates (n = 100) were monitored for the first two hours after birth by pulse oximetry. The impact of maternal and perinatal factors on the frequency and severity of desaturations (<85%) and bradycardia (<80/min) was evaluated. Results: Desaturations were detected in 30%, prolonged desaturations in 25% of infants. Desaturations were observed significantly more often in infants born by planned Cesarean section (pCs) compared to other modes of delivery (pCs 20/49; others 10/51; p = .029). Desaturations were also more frequent in infants diagnosed with neonatal infection (NI) or infants born to a mother with gestational diabetes (GDM), although not significantly. No bradycardia Conclusions: In our collective 4% of healthy term neonates had prolonged, clinically relevant desaturations in the first hours after birth. The mode of delivery and maternal risk factors may increase the risk for these events. However, our cohort was too small to detect any ALTE or SIDS and determine potential risk factors for these events. Our data lay ground for a large-scale prospective trial to investigate whether the mode of delivery could be an indication for general pulse oximetry monitoring of newborn in the delivery room.",

      "abstractNote": "In recent decades, several important advances have taken place in the understanding of the pathogenesis underlying membranous nephropathy (MN) that have sparked renewed interest in its management. Four landmark trials in MN and a fifth clinical trial-which was a pilot study-have been published in recent years. The results from some of these trials have had a significant impact on the recommendations included in the 2021 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Guideline for the Management of Glomerular Diseases, representing a significant step forward compared with the previous guideline in several aspects, including diagnosis, disease monitoring and treatment strategies. However, considering the rapidly evolving advances in the knowledge of MN and the recent publication of the STARMEN and RI-CYCLO trials, several recommendations contained in the guideline warrant updates. This article provides a perspective of the Immunonephrology Working Group of the European Renal Association regarding the management of MN in native kidneys of adult patients.",

      "title": "Correcting for Bias in Psychology: A Comparison of Meta-Analytic Methods",
      "abstractNote": "Publication bias and questionable research practices in primary research can lead to badly overestimated effects in meta-analysis. Methodologists have proposed a variety of statistical approaches to correct for such overestimation. However, it is not clear which methods work best for data typically seen in psychology. Here, we present a comprehensive simulation study in which we examined how some of the most promising meta-analytic methods perform on data that might realistically be produced by research in psychology. We simulated several levels of questionable research practices, publication bias, and heterogeneity, and used study sample sizes empirically derived from the literature. Our results clearly indicated that no single meta-analytic method consistently outperformed all the others. Therefore, we recommend that meta-analysts in psychology focus on sensitivity analyses-that is, report on a variety of methods, consider the conditions under which these methods fail (as indicated by simulation studies such as ours), and then report how conclusions might change depending on which conditions are most plausible. Moreover, given the dependence of meta-analytic methods on untestable assumptions, we strongly recommend that researchers in psychology continue their efforts to improve the primary literature and conduct large-scale, preregistered replications. We provide detailed results and simulation code at https://osf.io/rf3ys and interactive figures at http://www.shiny apps.org/apps/metaExplorer/.",

      "abstractNote": "Background In 2004, researchers reported that the number of nephrology clinical trials was low and that the reporting quality of such trials was suboptimal. Furthermore, the number or quality of preclinical kidney-related studies has not been systematically evaluated.\nMethods We performed a systematic review of randomized clinical trials published in 1966-2017 (listed in the Cochrane Library) and preclinical studies published in 1945-2017 (listed in PubMed). For reporting quality analysis, we evaluated the final main paper of 118 clinical trial reports and 135 preclinical studies published in leading journals in 1996,2006, and 2016 on the basis of criteria from the widely used CONSORT and ARRIVE guidelines.\nResults The annual number of reports of clinical kidney-related trials more than doubled between 2004 and 2014 along with reports in other medical disciplines. Hypertension remains the dominant focus of study, but ongoing trials also center on CKD, ESRD, and AKI. The reporting quality analysis revealed improvements, but deficits in reporting of clinical trial design, mode of randomization, and intention-totreat analysis remain. Annual numbers of kidney-related preclinical studies remained low between 1945 and 2017 compared with other disciplines. Reporting quality analysis of preclinical studies revealed substantial reporting deficits across all leading journals, with little improvement over the last 20 years, especially for group size calculations, defining primary versus secondary outcomes, and blinded analysis.\nConclusions Nephrology studies keep increasing in number but still lag behind other medical disciplines, and the quality of data reporting in kidney research can be further improved.",

      "abstractNote": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a global public healthcare concern in the pediatric population, where glomerulopathies represent the second most common cause. Although classification and diagnosis of glomerulopathies still rely mostly on histopathological patterns, patient stratification should complement information supplied by kidney biopsy with clinical data and etiological criteria. Genetic determinants of glomerular injury are particularly relevant in children, with important implications for prognosis and treatment. Targeted therapies addressing the primary cause of the disease are available for a limited number of glomerular diseases. Consequently, in the majority of cases, the treatment of glomerulopathies is actually the treatment of CKD. The efficacy of the currently available strategies is limited, but new prospects evolve. Although the exact mechanisms of action are still under investigation, accumulating data in adults demonstrate the efficacy of sodium-glucose transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) in slowing the progression of CKD due to diabetic and non-diabetic kidney disease. SGLT2i has proved effective on other comorbidities, such as obesity, glycemic control, and cardiovascular risk that frequently accompany CKD. The use of SGLT2i is not yet approved in children. However, no pathophysiological clues theoretically exclude their application. The hallmark of pediatric CKD is the inevitable imbalance between the metabolic needs of a growing child and the functional capacity of a failing kidney to handle those needs. In this view, developing better strategies to address any modifiable progressor in kidney disease is mandatory, especially considering the long lifespan typical of the pediatric population. By improving the hemodynamic adaptation of the kidney and providing additional beneficial effects on the overall complications of CKD, SGLT2i is a candidate as a potentially innovative drug for the treatment of CKD and glomerular diseases in children.",

      "abstractNote": "This Review considers the principal regulators of the processes of biomineralization and crystallization in human physiology. In addition, disorders of biomineralization are discussed, including bone disorders and disorders of extraskeletal mineralization.\nThe physiological process of biomineralization is complex and deviation from it leads to a variety of diseases. Progress in the past 10 years has enhanced understanding of the genetic, molecular and cellular pathophysiology underlying these disorders; sometimes, this knowledge has both facilitated restoration of health and clarified the very nature of biomineralization as it occurs in humans. In this Review, we consider the principal regulators of mineralization and crystallization, and how dysregulation of these processes can lead to human disease. The knowledge acquired to date and gaps still to be filled are highlighted. The disorders of mineralization discussed comprise a broad spectrum of conditions that encompass bone disorders associated with alterations of mineral quantity and quality, as well as disorders of extraskeletal mineralization (hyperphosphataemic familial tumoural calcinosis). Included are disorders of alkaline phosphatase (hypophosphatasia) and phosphate homeostasis (X-linked hypophosphataemic rickets, fluorosis, rickets and osteomalacia). Furthermore, crystallopathies are covered as well as arterial and renal calcification. This Review discusses the current knowledge of biomineralization derived from basic and clinical research and points to future studies that will lead to new therapeutic approaches for biomineralization disorders.",

      "title": "Receptor-mediated mitophagy: An emerging therapeutic target in acute kidney injury",
      "abstractNote": "Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a global health concern associated with high morbidity and mortality. AKI etiology is linked to mitochondrial dysfunction along with oxidative stress and inflammation. The defective mitochondria are removed via mitophagy for maintaining cellular integrity. The main regulatory mechanisms of mitophagy in response to different stressors are Phosphatase and tensin homolog-induced kinase 1 (PINK1)/Parkin and receptor-mediated. Receptors like B-cell lymphoma 2/adenovirus E1B-interacting protein (BNIP3), BNIP3L, prohibitin2, tacrolimus (FK506)-binding protein8 (FKBP8), autophagy-beclin1-regulator1 (AMBRA1) and SMADubiquitination regulatory factor1 (SMURF1), etc. participate in receptor-mediated mitophagy. In recent studies, receptor-mediated mitophagy showed protective effects in AKI. This review summarizes the evidence related to mitophagy in AKI and outlines the significance of receptor-mediated mitophagy modulation as a possible therapeutic approach in AKI.",

      "abstractNote": "Data integration, i.e. the use of different sources of information for data analysis, is becoming one of the most important topics in modern statistics. Especially in, but not limited to, biomedical applications, a relevant issue is the combination of low-dimensional (e.g. clinical data) and high-dimensional (e.g. molecular data such as gene expressions) data sources in a prediction model. Not only the different characteristics of the data, but also the complex correlation structure within and between the two data sources, pose challenging issues. In this paper, we investigate these issues via simulations, providing some useful insight into strategies to combine low- and high-dimensional data in a regression prediction model. In particular, we focus on the effect of the correlation structure on the results, while accounting for the influence of our specific choices in the design of the simulation study.",

      "abstractNote": "Acute kidney injury (AKI) is frequent, often fatal and, for lack of specific therapies, can leave survivors with chronic kidney disease (CKD). We characterize the distribution of tubular cells (TC) undergoing polyploidy along AKI by DNA content analysis and single cell RNA-sequencing. Furthermore, we study the functional roles of polyploidization using transgenic models and drug interventions. We identify YAP1-driven TC polyploidization outside the site of injury as a rapid way to sustain residual kidney function early during AKI. This survival mechanism comes at the cost of senescence of polyploid TC promoting interstitial fibrosis and CKD in AKI survivors. However, targeting TC polyploidization after the early AKI phase can prevent AKI-CKD transition without influencing AKI lethality. Senolytic treatment prevents CKD by blocking repeated TC polyploidization cycles. These results revise the current pathophysiological concept of how the kidney responds to acute injury and identify a novel druggable target to improve prognosis in AKI survivors.",

      "title": "Improved Outcome Prediction Across Data Sources Through Robust Parameter Tuning",
      "abstractNote": "In many application areas, prediction rules trained based on high-dimensional data are subsequently applied to make predictions for observations from other sources, but they do not always perform well in this setting. This is because data sets from different sources can feature (slightly) differing distributions, even if they come from similar populations. In the context of high-dimensional data and beyond, most prediction methods involve one or several tuning parameters. Their values are commonly chosen by maximizing the cross-validated prediction performance on the training data. This procedure, however, implicitly presumes that the data to which the prediction rule will be ultimately applied, follow the same distribution as the training data. If this is not the case, less complex prediction rules that slightly underfit the training data may be preferable. Indeed, a tuning parameter does not only control the degree of adjustment of a prediction rule to the training data, but also, more generally, the degree of adjustment to thedistribution ofthe training data. On the basis of this idea, in this paper we compare various approaches including new procedures for choosing tuning parameter values that lead to better generalizing prediction rules than those obtained based on cross-validation. Most of these approaches use an external validation data set. In our extensive comparison study based on a large collection of 15 transcriptomic data sets, tuning on external data and robust tuning with a tuned robustness parameter are the two approaches leading to better generalizing prediction rules.",

      "abstractNote": "Although many studies supported the use of actuarial risk assessment instruments (ARAIs) because they outperformed unstructured judgments, it remains an ongoing challenge to seek potentials for improvement of their predictive performance. Machine learning (ML) algorithms, like random forests, are able to detect patterns in data useful for prediction purposes without explicitly programming them (e.g., by considering nonlinear effects between risk factors and the criterion). Therefore, the current study aims to compare conventional logistic regression analyses with the random forest algorithm on a sample of N = 511 adult male individuals convicted of sexual offenses. Data were collected at the Federal Evaluation Center for Violent and Sexual Offenders in Austria within a prospective-longitudinal research design and participants were followed-up for an average of M = 8.2 years. The Static-99, containing static risk factors, and the Stable-2007, containing stable dynamic risk factors, were included as predictors. The results demonstrated no superior predictive performance of the random forest compared with logistic regression; furthermore, methods of interpretable ML did not point to any robust nonlinear effects. Altogether, results supported the statistical use of logistic regression for the development and clinical application of ARAIs.",

      "abstractNote": "Objective To update the 2012 EULAR/ERA-EDTA recommendations for the management of lupus nephritis (LN).\nMethods Following the EULAR standardised operating procedures, a systematic literature review was performed. Members of a multidisciplinary Task Force voted independently on their level of agreeement with the formed statements.\nResults The changes include recommendations for treatment targets, use of glucocorticoids and calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) and management of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). The target of therapy is complete response (proteinuria <0.5-0.7 g/24 hours with (near-) normal glomerular filtration rate) by 12 months, but this can be extended in patients with baseline nephrotic-range proteinuria. Hydroxychloroquine is recommended with regular ophthalmological monitoring. In active proliferative LN, initial (induction) treatment with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF 2-3 g/ day or mycophenolic acid (MPA) at equivalent dose) or low-dose intravenous cyclophosphamide (CY; 500 mg x 6 biweekly doses), both combined with glucocorticoids (pulses of intravenous methylprednisolone, then oral prednisone 0.3-0.5 mg/kg/day) is recommended. MMF/CNI (especially tacrolimus) combination and high-dose CY are alternatives, for patients with nephrotic-range proteinuria and adverse prognostic factors. Subsequent long-term maintenance treatment with MMF or azathioprine should follow, with no or low-dose (<7.5 mg/day) glucocorticoids. The choice of agent depends on the initial regimen and plans for pregnancy. In non-responding disease, switch of induction regimens or rituximab are recommended. In pure membranous LN with nephrotic-range proteinuria or proteinuria >1 g/24 hours despite renin-angiotensin-aldosterone blockade, MMF in combination with glucocorticoids is preferred. Assessment for kidney and extra-renal disease activity, and management of comorbidities is lifelong with repeat kidney biopsy in cases of incomplete response or nephritic flares. In ESKD, transplantation is the preferred kidney replacement option with immunosuppression guided by transplant protocols and/or extra-renal manifestations. Treatment of LN in children follows the same principles as adult disease.\nConclusions We have updated the EULAR recommendations for the management of LN to facilitate homogenization of patient care.",

      "abstractNote": "U-statistics enjoy good properties such as asymptotic normality, unbiasedness and minimal variance among unbiased estimators. The estimation of their variance is often of interest, for instance to derive asymptotic tests. It is well-known that an unbiased estimator of the variance of a U-statistic can be formulated explicitly as a U-statistic itself, but specific dependencies on the sample size make asymptotic statements difficult. Here, we solve the issue by decomposing the variance estimator into a linear combination of U-statistics with fixed kernel size, consequently obtaining a straightforward statement on the asymptotic distribution. We subsequently demonstrate a central limit theorem for the studentized estimator. We show that it leads to a hypothesis test which compares the error estimates of two prediction algorithms and permits construction of an asymptotically exact confidence interval for the true difference of errors. The test is illustrated by a real data application and a simulation study. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

      "title": "MDM2 inhibitor ameliorates cisplatin-induced nephropathy via NF kappa B signal inhibition",
      "abstractNote": "Cisplatin is a platinum-containing chemotherapeutic drug, which is widely used and highly effective. While effective against tumors, its use is limited by severe side effects such as nephrotoxicity and bone marrow suppression. Murine double minute 2 (MDM2) is the E3 ubiquitin ligase of the tumor suppressor gene, p53, and inhibition of MDM2 can suppress tumor cell growth. However, independent of p53, MDM2 acts as a co-transcription factor for nuclear factor-kappa B (NF kappa B), whose signaling can be involved in cisplatin-induced tubular injury. We therefore examined the effects of MDM2 inhibitor on cisplatin cytotoxicity. In order to induce acute kidney injury and to investigate MDM2 inhibitory effects, we injected cisplatin into rats with or without the MDM2 inhibitor, DS-5272, and analyzed kidney physiology/histology and NF kappa B signaling. Serum creatinine was significantly lower in the DS-5272 group than in the vehicle group on day 3 (0.55 +/- 0.069 vs 0.70 +/- 0.072 mg/dL, P < 0.05). DS-5272 also significantly decreased kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) expression, improved tubular injury, and decreased apoptotic cells. Western blotting showed that cisplatin increased NF kappa B phosphorylation in kidneys, which was significantly suppressed by DS-5272. In vitro, we treated HEK 293 cells with cisplatin, in the absence or presence of DS-5272, and examined cytotoxicity and NF kappa B transcriptional activity. DS-5272 co-treatment reduced both cisplatin-induced cell death and NF kappa B transcriptional activity. Collectively, these findings suggest that DS-5272 can ameliorate cisplatin nephrotoxicity via NF kappa B signal inhibition.",

      "abstractNote": "Epigenetic modifications (e.g. DNA methylation) in NAFLD and their contribution to disease progression and extrahepatic complications are poorly explored. Here, we use an integrated epigenome and transcriptome analysis of mouse NAFLD hepatocytes and identify alterations in glyoxylate metabolism, a pathway relevant in kidney damage via oxalate release-a harmful waste product and kidney stone-promoting factor. Downregulation and hypermethylation of alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase (Agxt), which detoxifies glyoxylate, preventing excessive oxalate accumulation, is accompanied by increased oxalate formation after metabolism of the precursor hydroxyproline. Viral-mediated Agxt transfer or inhibiting hydroxyproline catabolism rescues excessive oxalate release. In human steatotic hepatocytes, AGXT is also downregulated and hyper methylated, and in NAFLD adolescents, steatosis severity correlates with urinary oxalate excretion. Thus, this work identifies a reduced capacity of the steatotic liver to detoxify glyoxylate, triggering elevated oxalate, and provides a mechanistic explanation for the increased risk of kidney stones and chronic kidney disease in NAFLD patients.",

      "abstractNote": "Acute organ injury, such as acute kidney injury (AKI) and disease (AKD), are major causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Hyperuricemia (HU) is common in patients with impaired kidney function but the impact of asymptomatic HU on the different phases of AKI/AKD is incompletely understood. We hypothesized that asymptomatic HU would attenuate AKD because soluble, in contrast to crystalline, uric acid (sUA) can attenuate sterile inflammation. In vitro, 10 mg/dL sUA decreased reactive oxygen species and interleukin-6 production in macrophages, while enhancing fatty acid oxidation as compared with a physiological concentration of 5 mg/dL sUA or medium. In transgenic mice, asymptomatic HU of 7-10 mg/dL did not affect post-ischemic AKI/AKD but accelerated the recovery of kidney excretory function on day 14. Improved functional outcome was associated with better tubular integrity, less peritubular inflammation, and interstitial fibrosis. Mechanistic studies suggested that HU shifted macrophage polarization towards an anti-inflammatory M2-like phenotype characterized by expression of anti-oxidative and metabolic genes as compared with post-ischemic AKI-chronic kidney disease transition in mice without HU. Our data imply that asymptomatic HU acts as anti-oxidant on macrophages and tubular epithelial cells, which endorses the recovery of kidney function and structure upon AKI.",

In our commentary, we argue that claims (a) and (b) may be correct, but they have nothing to do with each other. Thus, claim (c) - that a liberal bias among scholars and course instructors leads to \"indoctrination\" in introductory courses and textbooks - is unsubstantiated and actually detrimental.",

      "abstractNote": "Purpose: We examined in a longitudinal study the role of sodium selenite in sepsis patents in strengthening the immune performance in whole blood samples using immune functional assays.\nMaterials and methods: This was a sub-study from a randomized, double blinded multicenter clinical trial (SISPCT) registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT00832039) and with data collected al our center. Full blood samples were incubated with various recall antigens and the supernatants were measured for their cytokine concentrations as markers for immune response. Data from days 0,4, 7, 14, and 21 (from sepsis onset) were analyzed using a generalized least squares model in R to appropriately take the longitudinal structure and the missing values into account.\nResults: From the 76 patients enrolled in the study at our center, 40 were randomized to selenium therapy and 36 to placebo. The analyses of immune response assay data showed no statistical difference between the selenium and placebo groups at each of the time points. There was however an overall dampening of cytokine release, which tended to recover over time in both groups.\nConclusion: Selenium has long been an adjuvant therapy in treating sepsis. Recently, it was proven to not have beneficial effects on the mortality outcome. Using data from our center in this sub-cohort study, we identified no relative improvement in cytokine release of stimulated blood immune cells ex vivo from patients with selenium therapy over a three-week period. This offers a potential explanation for the lack of beneficial effects of selenium in sepsis patients. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Inc.",

      "abstractNote": "Acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are global health concerns with increasing rates in morbidity and mortality. Transition from AKI-to-CKD is common and requires awareness in the management of AKI survivors. AKI-to-CKD transition is a main risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disease and progression to end-stage kidney disease. The mechanisms driving AKI-to-CKD transition are being explored to identify potential molecular and cellular targets for renoprotective drug interventions. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and autophagy are involved in the process of AKI-to-CKD transition. Excessive ER stress results in the persistent activation of unfolded protein response, which is an underneath cause of kidney cell death. Moreover, ER stress modulates autophagy and vice-versa. Autophagy is a degradation defensive mechanism protecting cells from malfunction. However, the underlying pathological mechanism involved in this interplay in the context of AKI-to-CKD transition is still unclear. In this review, we discuss the crosstalk between ER stress and autophagy in AKI, AKI-to-CKD transition, and CKD progression. In addition, we explore possible therapeutic targets that can regulate ER stress and autophagy to prevent AKI-to-CKD transition to improve the long-term prognosis of AKI survivors.",

      "abstractNote": "Glycoprotein VI (GPVI) is a platelet-specific receptor for collagen and fibrin, regulating important platelet functions such as platelet adhesion and thrombus growth. Although the blockade of GPVI function is widely recognized as a potent anti-thrombotic approach, there are limited studies focused on site-specific targeting of GPVI. Using computational modeling and bioinformatics, we analyzed collagen- and CRP-binding surfaces of GPVI monomers and dimers, and compared the interacting surfaces with other mammalian GPVI isoforms. We could predict a minimal collagen-binding epitope of GPVI dimer and designed an EA-20 antibody that recognizes a linear epitope of this surface. Using platelets and whole blood samples donated from wild-type and humanized GPVI transgenic mice and also humans, our experimental results show that the EA-20 antibody inhibits platelet adhesion and aggregation in response to collagen and CRP, but not to fibrin. The EA-20 antibody also prevents thrombus formation in whole blood, on the collagen-coated surface, in arterial flow conditions. We also show that EA-20 does not influence GPVI clustering or receptor shedding. Therefore, we propose that blockade of this minimal collagen-binding epitope of GPVI with the EA-20 antibody could represent a new anti-thrombotic approach by inhibiting specific interactions between GPVI and the collagen matrix.",

The Bayes factor provides a method for quantifying the relative evidence for two competing hypotheses that are both instantiated by specific statistical models with prior distributions on the parameters. This general approach can be used to address many specific, theoretically relevant research questions. The present review highlights the potential of the Bayes factor in psychological research. We discuss six types of applications: whether a randomized experiment has an effect or not (point null hypothesis), whether an effect is inside or outside a range of negligible effect sizes (interval hypothesis), whether a set of means follows a specific order (informative hypothesis), whether a set of studies jointly corroborate a theoretical claim (evidence synthesis), which variables are most relevant for prediction (variable selection), and which model provides the best account of latent processes (cognitive modeling). We elaborate what each application entails, give illustrative examples with reproducible files for the software R and JASP, and provide an overview of key references and software with links to other applications. We concluded with a discussion of the opportunities and pitfalls of the Bayes factor.",

      "title": "Large-scale benchmark study of survival prediction methods using multi-omics data",
      "abstractNote": "Multi-omics data, that is, datasets containing different types of high-dimensional molecular variables, are increasingly often generated for the investigation of various diseases. Nevertheless, questions remain regarding the usefulness of multi-omics data for the prediction of disease outcomes such as survival time. It is also unclear which methods are most appropriate to derive such prediction models. We aim to give some answers to these questions through a large-scale benchmark study using real data. Different prediction methods from machine learning and statistics were applied on 18 multi-omics cancer datasets (35 to 1000 observations, up to 100 000 variables) from the database 'The Cancer Genome Atlas' (TCGA). The considered outcome was the (censored) survival time. Eleven methods based on boosting, penalized regression and random forest were compared, comprising both methods that do and that do not take the group structure of the omics variables into account. The Kaplan-Meier estimate and a Cox model using only clinical variables were used as reference methods. The methods were compared using several repetitions of 5-fold cross-validation. Uno's C-index and the integrated Brier score served as performance metrics. The results indicate that methods taking into account the multi-omics structure have a slightly better prediction performance. Taking this structure into account can protect the predictive information in low-dimensional groups-especially clinical variables-from not being exploited during prediction. Moreover, only the block forest method outperformed the Cox model on average, and only slightly. This indicates, as a by-product of our study, that in the considered TCGA studies the utility of multi-omics data for prediction purposes was limited.

      "abstractNote": "The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic led to rapid vaccine development and large global vaccination schemes. However, patients with immune-mediated kidney disease, chronic kidney diseases and kidney transplant recipients show high non-response rates to vaccination despite more than three vaccinations and, consequently, reduced viral clearance capacity when infected while receiving certain immunosuppressants, carrying an elevated risk for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related morbidity and mortality. SARS-CoV-2 evolution has been characterized by the emergence of novel variants and spike mutations contributing to waning efficacy of neutralizing antibodies. To this end, the therapeutic field expands from vaccination towards a combined approach of immunization, pre-exposure prophylaxis and early post-exposure treatment using direct-acting antivirals and neutralizing monoclonal antibodies to treat early in the disease course and avoid hospitalization. This expert opinion paper from the Immunonephrology Working Group of the European Renal Association (ERA-IWG) summarizes available prophylactic and/or early treatment options (i.e. neutralizing monoclonal antibodies and direct-acting antivirals) of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with immune-mediated kidney disease, chronic kidney disease and kidney transplant recipients.",

      "title": "COMPANION: development of a patient-centred complexity and casemix classification for adult palliative care patients based on needs and resource use - a protocol for a cross- sectional multi-centre study",
      "abstractNote": "Background: A casemix classification based on patients' needs can serve to better describe the patient group in palliative care and thus help to develop adequate future care structures and enable national benchmarking and quality control. However, in Germany, there is no such an evidence-based system to differentiate the complexity of patients' needs in palliative care. Therefore, the study aims to develop a patient-oriented, nationally applicable complexity and casemix classification for adult palliative care patients in Germany.\nMethods: COMPANION is a mixed-methods study with data derived from three subprojects. Subproject 1: Prospective, cross-sectional multi-centre study collecting data on patients' needs which reflect the complexity of the respective patient situation, as well as data on resources that are required to meet these needs in specialist palliative care units, palliative care advisory teams, and specialist palliative home care. Subproject 2: Qualitative study including the development of a literature-based preliminary list of characteristics, expert interviews, and a focus group to develop a taxonomy for specialist palliative care models. Subproject 3: Multi-centre costing study based on resource data from subproject 1 and data of study centres. Data and results from the three subprojects will inform each other and form the basis for the development of the casemix classification. Ultimately, the casemix classification will be developed by applying Classification and Regression Tree (CART) analyses using patient and complexity data from subproject 1 and patient-related cost data from subproject 3.\nDiscussion: This is the first multi-centre costing study that integrates the structure and process characteristics of different palliative care settings in Germany with individual patient care. The mixed methods design and variety of included data allow for the development of a casemix classification that reflect on the complexity of the research subject. The consecutive inclusion of all patients cared for in participating study centres within the time of data collection allows for a comprehensive description of palliative care patients and their needs. A limiting factor is that data will be collected at least partly during the COVID-19 pandemic and potential impact of the pandemic on health care and the research topic cannot be excluded.",

      "abstractNote": "For a given research question, there are usually a large variety of possible analysis strategies acceptable according to the scientific standards of the field, and there are concerns that this multiplicity of analysis strategies plays an important role in the non-replicability of research findings. Here, we define a general framework on common sources of uncertainty arising in computational analyses that lead to this multiplicity, and apply this framework within an overview of approaches proposed across disciplines to address the issue. Armed with this framework, and a set of recommendations derived therefrom, researchers will be able to recognize strategies applicable to their field and use them to generate findings more likely to be replicated in future studies, ultimately improving the credibility of the scientific process.",

      "title": "\"Point of no return\" in unilateral renal ischemia reperfusion injury in mice",
      "abstractNote": "Background In the past years evidence has been growing about the interconnection of chronic kidney disease and acute kidney injury. The underlying pathophysiological mechanisms remain unclear. We hypothesized, that a threshold ischemia time in unilateral ischemia/reperfusion injury sets an extent of ischemic tubule necrosis, which as \"point of no return\" leads to progressive injury. This progress is temporarily associated by increased markers of inflammation and results in fibrosis and atrophy of the ischemic kidney. Methods Acute tubule necrosis was induced by unilateral ischemia/reperfusion injury in male C57BL/6 N mice with different ischemia times (15, 25, 35, and 45 min). At multiple time points between 15 min and 5 weeks we assessed gene expression of markers for injury, inflammation, and fibrosis, histologically the injury of tubules, cell death (TUNEL), macrophages, neutrophil influx and kidney atrophy. Results Unilateral ischemia for 15 and 25 min induced upregulation of markers for injury after reperfusion for 24 h but no upregulation after 5 weeks. None of the markers for inflammation or fibrosis were upregulated after ischemia for 15 and 25 min at 24 h or 5 weeks on a gene expression level, except for Il-6. Ischemia for 35 and 45 min consistently induced upregulation of markers for inflammation, injury, and partially of fibrosis (Tgf-beta 1 and Col1a1) at 24 h and 5 weeks. The threshold ischemia time for persistent injury of 35 min induced a temporal association of markers for inflammation and injury with peaks between 6 h and 7 d along the course of 10 d. This ischemia time also induced persistent cell death (TUNEL) throughout observation for 5 weeks with a peak at 6 h and progressing kidney atrophy beginning 7 d after ischemia. Conclusions This study confirms the evidence of a threshold extent of ischemic injury in which markers of injury, inflammation and fibrosis do not decline to baseline but remain upregulated assessed in long term outcome (5 weeks). Excess of this threshold as \"point of no return\" leads to persistent cell death and progressing atrophy and is characterized by a temporal association of markers for inflammation and injury.",

      "abstractNote": "The NLRP3 inflammasome transforms a wide variety of infectious and non-infectious danger signals that activate pro-inflammatory caspases, which promote the secretion of IL-1 & beta; and IL-18, and pyroptosis, a pro-inflammatory form of cell necrosis. Most published evidence documents the presence and importance of the NLRP3 inflammasome in monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils during host defense and sterile forms of inflammation. In contrast, in numerous unbiased data sets, NLRP3 inflammasome-related transcripts are absent in non-immune cells. However, an increasing number of studies report the presence and functionality of the NLRP3 inflammasome in almost every cell type. Here, we take a closer look at the reported cell type-specific expression of the NLRP3 inflammasome components, review the reported inflammasome-dependent and -independent functions, and discuss possible explanations for this discrepancy.",

      "title": "Interaction forests: Identifying and exploiting interpretable quantitative and qualitative interaction effects",
      "abstractNote": "Although interaction effects can be exploited to improve predictions and allow for valuable insights into covariate interplay, they are given limited attention in analysis. Interaction forests are a variant of random forests for categorical, continuous, and survival outcomes that explicitly models quantitative and qualitative interaction effects in bivariable splits performed by the trees constituting the forests. The new effect importance measure (EIM) associated with interaction forests allows for ranking of covariate pairs with respect to their interaction effects' importance to prediction. Using EIM, separate importance value lists for univariable effects, quantitative interaction effects, and qualitative interaction effects are obtained. In the spirit of interpretable machine learning, the bivariable split types of interaction forests target easily interpretable and communicable interaction effects. To learn about the nature of the interplay between covariates identified as interacting it is convenient to visualise their estimated bivariable influence. Functions that perform this task are provided in the R package diversityForest, which implements interaction forests. In a large-scale empirical study using 220 data sets, interaction forests tended to deliver better predictions than conventional random forests and competing random forest variants that use multivariable splitting. In a simulation study, EIM delivered considerably better rankings for the relevant quantitative and qualitative interaction effects than competing approaches. These results indicate that interaction forests are suitable tools for the challenging task of identifying and making use of easily interpretable and communicable interaction effects in predictive modelling.

      "abstractNote": "As the availability of omics data has increased in the last few years, more multi-omics data have been generated, that is, high-dimensional molecular data consisting of several types such as genomic, transcriptomic, or proteomic data, all obtained from the same patients. Such data lend themselves to being used as covariates in automatic outcome prediction because each omics type may contribute unique information, possibly improving predictions compared to using only one omics data type. Frequently, however, in the training data and the data to which automatic prediction rules should be applied, the test data, the different omics data types are not available for all patients. We refer to this type of data as block-wise missing multi-omics data. First, we provide a literature review on existing prediction methods applicable to such data. Subsequently, using a collection of 13 publicly available multi-omics data sets, we compare the predictive performances of several of these approaches for different block-wise missingness patterns. Finally, we discuss the results of this empirical comparison study and draw some tentative conclusions.This article is categorized under:Applications of Computational Statistics > Genomics/Proteomics/GeneticsApplications of Computational Statistics > Health and Medical Data/InformaticsStatistical and Graphical Methods of Data Analysis > Analysis of High Dimensional Data",

      "abstractNote": "Empirical research on the (mal-) adaptiveness of favorable self-perceptions, self-enhancement, and self-knowledge has typically applied a classical null-hypothesis testing approach and provided mixed and even contradictory findings. Using data from 5 studies (laboratory and field, total N = 2,823), we used an information-theoretic approach combined with Response Surface Analysis to provide the first competitive test of 6 popular hypotheses: that more favorable self-perceptions are adaptive versus maladaptive (Hypotheses 1 and 2: Positivity of self-view hypotheses), that higher levels of self-enhancement (i.e., a higher discrepancy of self-viewed and objectively assessed ability) are adaptive versus maladaptive (Hypotheses 3 and 4: Self-enhancement hypotheses), that accurate self-perceptions are adaptive (Hypothesis 5: Self-knowledge hypothesis), and that a slight degree of self-enhancement is adaptive (Hypothesis 6: Optimal margin hypothesis). We considered self-perceptions and objective ability measures in two content domains (reasoning ability, vocabulary knowledge) and investigated 6 indicators of intra-and interpersonal psychological adjustment. Results showed that most adjustment indicators were best predicted by the positivity of self-perceptions. There were some specific self-enhancement effects, and evidence generally spoke against the self-knowledge and optimal margin hypotheses. Our results highlight the need for comprehensive and simultaneous tests of competing hypotheses. Implications for the understanding of underlying processes are discussed.",

      "title": "Cubic Response Surface Analysis: Investigating Asymmetric and Level-Dependent Congruence Effects With Third-Order Polynomial Models",
      "abstractNote": "Congruence hypotheses play a major role in many areas of psychology. They refer to, for example, the consequences of person-environment fit, similarity, or self-other agreement. For example, are people psychologically better adjusted when their self-view is in line with their reputation? A valid statistical approach that can be applied to investigate congruence hypotheses of this kind is quadratic Response Surface Analysis (RSA) in which a second-order polynomial model is fit to the data and appropriately interpreted. However, quadratic RSA does not allow researchers to investigate more precise expectations about a congruence effect. Do the data support an asymmetric congruence effect, in the sense that congruence leads to the highest (or lowest) outcome, but incongruence in one direction (e.g., self-view exceeds reputation) affects the outcome differently than incongruence in the other direction (e.g., self-view falls behind reputation)? Is there a level-dependent congruence effect, such that the amount of congruence is more strongly related to the outcome variable for some levels of the predictors (e.g., high self-view and reputation) than for others (e.g., low self-view and reputation)? Such complex congruence hypotheses have frequently been suggested in the literature, but they could not be investigated because an appropriate statistical approach has yet to be developed. Here, we present analytical strategies, based on third-order polynomial models, that enable users to investigate asymmetric and level-dependent congruence effects, respectively. To facilitate the correct application of the suggested approaches, we provide respective step-by-step guidelines, corresponding R syntax, and illustrative analyses using simulated and real data.",

      "abstractNote": "Condition-based regression analysis (CRA) is a statistical method for testing self-enhancement effects. That is, CRA indicates whether, in a set of empirical data, people with higher values on the directed discrepancy self-view S minus reality criterion R (i.e., S-R) tend to have higher values on some outcome variable (e.g., happiness). In a critical comment, Fiedler (2021) claims that CRA yields inaccurate conclusions in data with a suppressor effect. Here, we show that Fiedler's critique is unwarranted. All data that are simulated in his comment show a positive association between S-R and H, which is accurately detected by CRA. By construction, CRA indicates an association between S-R and H only when it is present in the data. In contrast to Fiedler's claim, it also yields valid conclusions when the outcome variable is related only to the self-view or when there is a suppressor effect. Our clarifications provide guidance for evaluating Fiedler's comment, clear up with the common heuristic that suppressor effects are always problematic, and assist readers in fully understanding CRA.",

      "abstractNote": "Appraisal theories are a prominent approach for the explanation and prediction of emotions. According to these theories, the subjective perception of an emotion results from a series of specific event evaluations. To validate and extend one of the most known representatives of appraisal theory, the Component Process Model by Klaus Scherer, we implemented four computational appraisal models that predicted emotion labels based on prototype similarity calculations. Different weighting algorithms, mapping the models' input to a distinct emotion label, were integrated in the models. We evaluated the plausibility of the models' structure by assessing their predictive power and comparing their performance to a baseline model and a highly predictive machine learning algorithm. Model parameters were estimated from empirical data and validated out-of-sample. All models were notably better than the baseline model and able to explain part of the variance in the emotion labels. The preferred model, yielding a relatively high performance and stable parameter estimations, was able to predict a correct emotion label with an accuracy of 40.2 percent and a correct emotion family with an accuracy of 76.9 percent. The weighting algorithm of this favored model corresponds to the weighting complexity implied by the Component Process Model, but uses differing weighting parameters.",

      "abstractNote": "The present study explored the interrelations between a broad set of appraisal ratings and five physiological signals, including facial EMG, electrodermal activity, and heart rate variability, that were assessed in 157 participants watching 10 emotionally charged videos. A total of 134 features were extracted from the physiological data, and a benchmark comparing different kinds of machine learning algorithms was conducted to test how well the appraisal dimensions can be predicted from these features. For 13 out of 21 appraisals, a robust positiveR(2)was attained, indicating that the dimensions are actually related to the considered physiological channels. The highestR(2)(.407) was reached for the appraisal dimensionintrinsic pleasantness. Moreover, the comparison of linear and nonlinear algorithms and the inspection of the links between the appraisals and single physiological features usingaccumulated local effectsplots indicates that the relationship between physiology and appraisals is nonlinear. By constructing different importance measures for the assessed physiological channels, we showed that for the 13 predictable appraisals, the five channels explained different amounts of variance and that only a few blocks incrementally explained variance beyond the other physiological channels.",

      "title": "Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor teneligliptin accelerates recovery from cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury by attenuating inflammation and promoting tubular regeneration",
      "abstractNote": "Background. Cisplatin is an effective chemotherapeutic agent. However, acute kidney injury (AKI) and subsequent kidney function decline limits its use. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor has been reported to attenuate kidney injury in some in vivo models, but the mechanisms-of-action in tubule recovery upon AKI remain speculative. We hypothesized that DPP-4 inhibitor teneligliptin (TG) can facilitate kidney recovery after cisplatin-induced AKI.\nMethods. In in vivo experiment, AKI was induced in rats by injecting 5 mg/kg of cisplatin intravenously. Oral administration of 10 mg/kg of TG, once a day, was started just before injecting cisplatin or from Day 5 after cisplatin injection. In an in vitro experiment, proliferation of isolated murine tubular cells was evaluated with 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, cell cycle analysis and cell counting. Cell viability was analysed by MTT assay or lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay.\nResults. In in vivo experiments, we found that TG attenuates cisplatin-induced AKI and accelerates kidney recovery after the injury by promoting the proliferation of surviving epithelial cells of the proximal tubule. TG also suppressed intrarenal tumour necrosis factor-alpha expression, and induced macrophage polarization towards the anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype, both indirectly endorsing tubule recovery upon cisplatin injury. In in vitro experiments, TG directly accelerated the proliferation of primary tubular epithelial cells. Systematic screening of the DPP-4 substrate chemokines in vitro identified CXC chemokine ligand (CXCL)-12 as a promoted mitogenic factor. CXCL12 not only accelerated proliferation but also inhibited cell death of primary tubular epithelial cells after cisplatin exposure. CXC chemokine receptor (CXCR)-4 antagonism abolished the proliferative effect of TG.\nConclusions. The DPP-4 inhibitor TG can accelerate tubule regeneration and functional recovery from toxic AKI via an anti-inflammatory effect and probably via inhibition of CXCL12 breakdown. Hence, DPP-4 inhibitors may limit cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity and improve kidney function in cancer patients.",

All of these applications are relevant for basic kidney research, e.g. on endothelial cells, tubular and glomerular epithelial cells.

      "title": "Diabetes and Cardiorenal Complications: A Clinical Review of Existing Therapies and Novel Combinations, Focusing on SGLT2 Inhibitors",
      "abstractNote": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a set of metabolic disorders specified by hyperglycemia as a result of abnormalities in insulin secretion or sensitivity. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) are the widespread co-morbidities of T2DM and share risk factors for onset and progression. Despite numerous mono- and combination therapies exist, the progression of diabetes complications remains a global health concern. Treatment options for diabetic- CKD and CVD include drugs targeting hyperglycemia, hypertension, albuminuria, hyperlipidemia and the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS). The sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 channel (SGLT2) is abundantly present in proximal tubules of the kidney and its capacity to recover glucose and sodium from the glomerular filtrate limits urinary glucose and sodium excretion. SGLT2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) reduce sodium and glucose reabsorption in the proximal and thus increase urinary glucose excretion in T2DM. SGLT2i monotherapy can improve but dual SGLT2/RAAS inhibition or SGLT2i along with other classes of drugs are more effective in protecting the kidneys and the cardiovascular system in patients with and without diabetes. Combinations such as empagliflozin and linagliptin, ertugliflozin and metolazone, dapagliflozin and sacubitril-valsartan and many more show promising results. Here, we have reviewed the ongoing and completed clinical trials, addressed current theories, and discussed necessary future research to explain the possible risks and benefits of using an SGLT2i alone and in combination with existing antidiabetic drugs and drugs acting on the cardiovascular system.",

      "abstractNote": "Klotho is a novel renoprotective anti-aging protein available in membrane-bound or soluble form. Klotho is expressed in brain, pancreas, and other solid organs but shows highest expression levels in the kidney. Klotho sustains normal kidney physiology but Klotho regulation also contributes to the progression of kidney disease. Systemic and intrarenal levels of Klotho fall drastically during acute kidney injury, kidney fibrosis, diabetic nephropathy, and other forms of chronic kidney disease, etc. Moreover, exogenous supplementation or overexpression of endogenous Klotho attenuates kidney disease. The regulation of endogenous Klotho expression involves epigenetic as well as non-epigenetic mechanisms. The epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation, post-translational histone modifications, miRNAs regulate the change in Klotho expression in kidney disease. Non-epigenetic mechanisms such as ER stress, Wnt signaling, activation of the renin angiotensin system (RAS), excessive reactive oxygen species and cytokine generation, albumin overload, and PPAR-gamma signaling also contribute to Klotho regulation. Evolving evidence highlight the capacity of natural products to regulate Klotho expression in kidney disease. All these preclinical data suggest that Klotho could be a novel biomarker as well as therapeutic target. Here we review the different mechanisms of Klotho regulation in the context of Klotho as a biomarker and potential therapeutic agent.",

      "abstractNote": "Antiviral drugs such as Remdesivir (Veklury), Nirmatrelvir with Ritonavir (Paxlovid), Azvudine, and Molnupiravir (Lagevrio) can reduce the risk for severe and fatal Coronavirus Disease (COVID)-19. Although chronic kidney disease is a highly prevalent risk factor for severe and fatal COVID-19, most clinical trials with these drugs excluded patients with impaired kidney function. Advanced CKD is associated with a state of secondary immunodeficiency (SIDKD), which increases the susceptibility to severe COVID-19, COVID-19 complications, and the risk of hospitalization and mortality among COVID-19 patients. The risk to develop COVID-19 related acute kidney injury is higher in patients with precedent CKD. Selecting appropriate therapies for COVID-19 patients with impaired kidney function is a challenge for healthcare professionals. Here, we discuss the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of COVID-19-related antiviral drugs with a focus on their potential use and dosing in COVID-19 patients with different stages of CKD. Additionally, we describe the adverse effects and precautions to be taken into account when using these antivirals in COVID-19 patients with CKD. Lastly, we also discuss about the use of monoclonal antibodies in COVID-19 patients with kidney disease and related complications.",

      "title": "Klotho in kidney diseases: a crosstalk between the renin-angiotensin system and endoplasmic reticulum stress",
      "abstractNote": "Klotho is a transmembrane anti-ageing protein that exists in three forms, i.e. alpha-Klotho, beta-Klotho and gamma-Klotho, with distinct organ-specific expression and functions in the body. Here we focus on alpha-Klotho (hereafter Klotho), abundantly expressed by the distal and proximal convoluted tubules of the kidney. A significant decline in systemic and renal Klotho levels is a new hallmark for kidney disease progression. Emerging research portrays Klotho as a promising diagnostic and therapeutic target for diabetic and non-diabetic kidney disease. Even so, the underlying mechanisms of Klotho regulation and the strategies to restore its systemic and renal levels are still lacking. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and/or angiotensin receptor blockers are the current standard of care for kidney diseases, but the molecular mechanisms for their nephroprotective action are still ambiguous. Moreover, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress also plays a crucial role in kidney disease progression. Few studies have claimed that the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) has a direct relation with ER stress generation and vice versa in kidney disease. Interestingly, RAAS and ER stress modulation are associated with Klotho regulation in kidney disease. Here we focus on how the RAAS and ER stress connect with Klotho regulation in kidney disease. We also discuss Klotho and ER stress in an alliance with the concept of haemodynamic and metabolic overload in kidney disease. In addition, we highlight novel approaches to implement Klotho as a therapeutic target via RAAS and ER stress modulation for the treatment of diabetic and non-diabetic kidney diseases.",

Sodium glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) are novel US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved antihyperglycemics with unexpected protective potential against cardiorenal diseases in patients with or without type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Despite initial concerns, the incidence of episodes of acute kidney injury (AKI) was significantly lower in patients taking SGLT2i compared with other therapies or placebo. Evolving data suggest a link between SGLT2is and the anti-aging protein Klotho in the amelioration of diabetes and cardiorenal diseases.

      "abstractNote": "Lupus nephritis (LN) is a severe complication of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), a polyclonal systemic autoimmunity directed against nuclear and other self-antigens. SLE/LN affects mostly females during childbearing age, which puts them at risk for the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD), cardiovascular disease, and pregnancy complications. The current management of LN involves the use of drugs with significant toxicities, and despite many attempts at novel drug interventions, the overall treatment efficacy has remained low. In this article, we discuss recent drug approvals and the upcoming pipeline of novel medications tested in clinical trials to improve effectiveness in terms of LN disease activity, LN relapse, and progression of LN-related CKD. In this context, we discuss (1) drugs with the potential to achieve these treatment goals by modulating SLE activity as the driving force for LN (e.g., belimumab, obinutuzumab, anifrolumab, and others); (2) drugs with SLE-non specific renoprotective effects by targeting non-immune mechanisms of LN progression (dapagliflozin, empagliflozin); and (3) drugs with dual immunosuppressive and antiproteinuric effects (voclosporin). Increasing the number of possible drug options will help to improve the management of LN in terms of efficacy and safety, and enable a more personalized treatment approach.",

      "abstractNote": "Acute kidney injury (AKI) describes a sudden loss of excretory kidney function that can result in long-term kidney damage. This Primer describes AKI epidemiology and pathophysiology in different economic settings, discusses current diagnostic and management principles, and highlights long-term effects on quality of life and initiatives to improve patient care.\nAcute kidney injury (AKI) is defined by a sudden loss of excretory kidney function. AKI is part of a range of conditions summarized as acute kidney diseases and disorders (AKD), in which slow deterioration of kidney function or persistent kidney dysfunction is associated with an irreversible loss of kidney cells and nephrons, which can lead to chronic kidney disease (CKD). New biomarkers to identify injury before function loss await clinical implementation. AKI and AKD are a global concern. In low-income and middle-income countries, infections and hypovolaemic shock are the predominant causes of AKI. In high-income countries, AKI mostly occurs in elderly patients who are in hospital, and is related to sepsis, drugs or invasive procedures. Infection and trauma-related AKI and AKD are frequent in all regions. The large spectrum of AKI implies diverse pathophysiological mechanisms. AKI management in critical care settings is challenging, including appropriate volume control, nephrotoxic drug management, and the timing and type of kidney support. Fluid and electrolyte management are essential. As AKI can be lethal, kidney replacement therapy is frequently required. AKI has a poor prognosis in critically ill patients. Long-term consequences of AKI and AKD include CKD and cardiovascular morbidity. Thus, prevention and early detection of AKI are essential.",

      "abstractNote": "Populations in the high-income countries of Western Europe are aging due to increased life expectancy. As the prevalence of diabetes and obesity has increased, so has the burden of kidney failure. To determine the global capacity for kidney replacement therapy and conservative kidney management, the International Society of Nephrology conducted multinational, cross-sectional surveys and published the findings in the International Society of Nephrology Global Kidney Health Atlas. In the second iteration of the International Society of Nephrology Global Kidney Health Atlas, we aimed to describe the availability, accessibility, quality, and affordability of kidney failure care in Western Europe. Among the 29 countries in Western Europe, 21 (72.4%) responded, representing 99% of the region's population. The burden of kidney failure prevalence varied widely, ranging from 760 per million population (pmp) in Iceland to 1612 pmp in Portugal. Coverage of kidney replacement therapy from public funding was nearly universal, with the exceptions of Germany and Liechtenstein where part of the costs was covered by mandatory insurance. Fourteen (67%) of 21 countries charged no fees at the point of care delivery, but in 5 countries (24%), patients do pay some out-of-pocket costs. Long-term dialysis services (both hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis) were available in all countries in the region, and kidney transplantation services were available in 19 (90%) countries. The incidence of kidney transplantation varied widely between countries from 12 pmp in Luxembourg to 70.45 pmp in Spain. Conservative kidney care was available in 18 (90%) of 21 countries. The median number of nephrologists was 22.9 pmp (range: 9.47-55.75 pmp). These data highlight the uniform capacity of Western Europe to provide kidney failure care, but also the scope for improvement in disease prevention and management, as exemplified by the variability in disease burden and transplantation rates.",

      "title": "Drug Crystal-Related Gastrointestinal Complications Involve Crystal-Induced Release of Neutrophil and Monocyte Extracellular Traps",
      "abstractNote": "Ion-exchange resins are commonly used to manage complications of chronic kidney disease, such as hyperphosphatemia, hyperkalemia, and hypercholesterolemia. Occasionally, these drugs can irritate the gastrointestinal lining and cause life-threatening intestinal necrosis. Currently, the pathophysiology of drug crystal-induced intestinal necrosis is not well understood. We hypothesized that crystals of ion-exchange resins like sevelamer, polystyrene sulfonate, and cholestyramine can trigger the formation of neutrophil and monocyte extracellular traps by contributing to intestinal barrier dysfunction. Light and fluorescence microscopy of the colonic resection specimen from a patient with chronic kidney disease revealed severe intestinal necrosis, ulceration, sevelamer crystals, and inflammation upon oral intake of sevelamer, as well as the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps in proximity to small sevelamer crystals. Indeed, drug crystals reduced metabolic activity and induced barrier dysfunction and cell death in human intestinal epithelial cells in vitro. In addition, drug crystals triggered the release of neutrophil and monocyte extracellular traps. Taken together, these data raise the possibility that besides other factors including chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension, drug crystals may further amplify a pre-existing barrier dysfunction and necroinflammation in a crescendo of local intestinal necrosis and systemic inflammation/infection, as occasionally observed in patients on ion-exchange resin therapy.",

      "abstractNote": "ObjectivePeople's psychological tendencies are attuned to their sociocultural context and culture-specific ways of being, feeling, and thinking are believed to assist individuals in successfully navigating their environment. Supporting this idea, a stronger \"fit\" with one's cultural environment has often been linked to positive psychological outcomes. The current research expands the cultural, conceptual, and methodological space of cultural fit research by exploring the link between well-being and honor, a central driver of social behavior in the Mediterranean region. MethodDrawing on a multi-national sample from eight countries circum-Mediterranean (N = 2257), we examined the relationship between cultural fit in honor and well-being at the distal level (fit with one's perceived society) using response surface analysis (RSA) and at the proximal level (fit with one's university gender group) using profile analysis. ResultsWe found positive links between fit and well-being in both distal (for some, but not all, honor facets) and proximal fit analyses (across all honor facets). Furthermore, most fit effects in the RSA were complemented with positive level effects of the predictors, with higher average honor levels predicting higher well-being. ConclusionsOur findings highlight the interplay between individual and environmental factors in honor as well as the important role honor plays in well-being in the Mediterranean region.",

      "abstractNote": "Treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) currently employs agents with relatively unselective immunosuppressive properties. However, two target-specific biological drugs have been approved: belimumab (anti-B-cell-activating factor/BAFF) and anifrolumab (anti-interferon alpha receptor-1/IFNAR1). Here, we performed a comparative risk-benefit assessment for both drugs based on the role of BAFF and IFNAR1 in host defense and the pathogenesis of SLE and by considering the available data on safety and efficacy. Due to differences in target expression sites, anti-IFNAR1, but not anti-BAFF, might elicit organ-specific effects, consistent with clinical efficacy data. The IFNAR1 is specifically involved in innate and adaptive antiviral immunity in most cells of the body. Consistent with this observation, the available safety data obtained from patients negatively selected for LN and neuropsychiatric SLE, primary immunodeficiencies, splenectomy and chronic HIV, HBV, HCV infections suggest an increased risk for some viral infections such as varicella zoster and perhaps influenza. In contrast, BAFF is mainly involved in adaptive immune responses in lymphoid tissues, thus anti-BAFF therapy modulates SLE activity and prevents SLE flares without interfering with local innate host defense mechanisms and should only marginally affect immune memory to previous pathogen exposures consistent with the available safety data from SLE patients without chronic HIV, HBV or HCV infections. When using belimumab and anifrolumab, careful patient stratification and specific precautions may minimize risks and maximize beneficial treatment effects for patients with SLE.",

      "abstractNote": "The anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitides (AAVs) are autoimmune disorders characterized by inflammation and destruction of small blood vessels. In this Primer, the authors discuss the classification of AAVs and the pathogenetic mechanisms, diagnosis and treatment of these debilitating conditions.\nThe anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitides (AAVs) are a group of disorders involving severe, systemic, small-vessel vasculitis and are characterized by the development of autoantibodies to the neutrophil proteins leukocyte proteinase 3 (PR3-ANCA) or myeloperoxidase (MPO-ANCA). The three AAV subgroups, namely granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), microscopic polyangiitis and eosinophilic GPA (EGPA), are defined according to clinical features. However, genetic and other clinical findings suggest that these clinical syndromes may be better classified as PR3-positive AAV (PR3-AAV), MPO-positive AAV (MPO-AAV) and, for EGPA, by the presence or absence of ANCA (ANCA(+)or ANCA(-), respectively). Although any tissue can be involved in AAV, the upper and lower respiratory tract and kidneys are most commonly and severely affected. AAVs have a complex and unique pathogenesis, with evidence for a loss of tolerance to neutrophil proteins, which leads to ANCA-mediated neutrophil activation, recruitment and injury, with effector T cells also involved. Without therapy, prognosis is poor but treatments, typically immunosuppressants, have improved survival, albeit with considerable morbidity from glucocorticoids and other immunosuppressive medications. Current challenges include improving the measures of disease activity and risk of relapse, uncertainty about optimal therapy duration and a need for targeted therapies with fewer adverse effects. Meeting these challenges requires a more detailed knowledge of the fundamental biology of AAV as well as cooperative international research and clinical trials with meaningful input from patients.",

      "abstractNote": "Background: The results of studies on observational associations may vary depending on the study design and analysis choices as well as due to measurement error. It is important to understand the relative contribution of different factors towards generating variable results, including low sample sizes, researchers' flexibility in model choices, and measurement error in variables of interest and adjustment variables.\nMethods: We define sampling, model and measurement uncertainty, and extend the concept of vibration of effects in order to study these three types of uncertainty in a common framework. In a practical application, we examine these types of uncertainty in a Cox model using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. In addition, we analyse the behaviour of sampling, model and measurement uncertainty for varying sample sizes in a simulation study.\nResults: All types of uncertainty are associated with a potentially large variability in effect estimates. Measurement error in the variable of interest attenuates the true effect in most cases, but can occasionally lead to overestimation. When we consider measurement error in both the variable of interest and adjustment variables, the vibration of effects are even less predictable as both systematic under- and over-estimation of the true effect can be observed. The results on simulated data show that measurement and model vibration remain non-negligible even for large sample sizes.\nConclusion: Sampling, model and measurement uncertainty can have important consequences for the stability of observational associations. We recommend systematically studying and reporting these types of uncertainty, and comparing them in a common framework.",

      "title": "Sampling uncertainty versus method uncertainty: A general framework with applications to omics biomarker selection",
      "abstractNote": "Uncertainty is a crucial issue in statistics which can be considered from different points of view. One type of uncertainty, typically referred to as sampling uncertainty, arises through the variability of results obtained when the same analysis strategy is applied to different samples. Another type of uncertainty arises through the variability of results obtained when using the same sample but different analysis strategies addressing the same research question. We denote this latter type of uncertainty as method uncertainty. It results from all the choices to be made for an analysis, for example, decisions related to data preparation, method choice, or model selection. In medical sciences, a large part of omics research is focused on the identification of molecular biomarkers, which can either be performed through ranking or by selection from among a large number of candidates. In this paper, we introduce a general resampling-based framework to quantify and compare sampling and method uncertainty. For illustration, we apply this framework to different scenarios related to the selection and ranking of omics biomarkers in the context of acute myeloid leukemia: variable selection in multivariable regression using different types of omics markers, the ranking of biomarkers according to their predictive performance, and the identification of differentially expressed genes from RNA-seq data. For all three scenarios, our findings suggest highly unstable results when the same analysis strategy is applied to two independent samples, indicating high sampling uncertainty and a comparatively smaller, but non-negligible method uncertainty, which strongly depends on the methods being compared.",

      "abstractNote": "Calcium oxalate (CaOx) crystal-induced nephropathies comprise a range of kidney disorders, for which there are no efficient pharmacological treatments. Although CaOx crystallization inhibitors have been suggested as a therapeutic modality already decades ago, limited progress has been made in the discovery of potent molecules with efficacy in animal disease models. Herein, an image-based machine learning approach to systematically screen chemically modified myo-inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) analogues is utilized, which enables the identification of a highly active divalent inositol phosphate molecule. To date, this is the first molecule shown to completely inhibit the crystallization process in the nanomolar range, reduce crystal-cell interactions, thereby preventing CaOx-induced transcriptomic changes, and decrease renal CaOx deposition and kidney injury in a mouse model of hyperoxaluria. In conclusion, IP6 analogues based on such a scaffold may represent a new treatment option for CaOx nephropathies.",

      "abstractNote": "Background Hereditary deficiency of adenine phosphoribosyltransferase causes 2,8-dihydroxyadenine (2,8-DHA) nephropathy, a rare condition characterized by formation of 2,8-DHA crystals within renal tubules. Clinical relevance of rodent models of 2,8-DHA crystal nephropathy induced by excessive adenine intake is unknown.\nMethods Using animal models and patient kidney biopsies, we assessed the pathogenic sequelae of 2,8-DHA crystal-induced kidney damage. We also used knockout mice to investigate the role of TNF receptors 1 and 2 (TNFR1 and TNFR2), CD44, or alpha2-HS glycoprotein (AHSG), all of which are involved in the pathogenesis of other types of crystal-induced nephropathies.\nResults Adenine-enriched diet in mice induced 2,8-DHA nephropathy, leading to progressive kidney disease, characterized by crystal deposits, tubular injury, inflammation, and fibrosis. Kidney injury depended on crystal size. The smallest crystals were endocytosed by tubular epithelial cells. Crystals of variable size were excreted in urine. Large crystals obstructed whole tubules. Medium-sized crystals induced a particular reparative process that we term extratubulation. In this process, tubular cells, in coordination with macrophages, overgrew and translocated crystals into the interstitium, restoring the tubular luminal patency; this was followed by degradation of interstitial crystals by granulomatous inflammation. Patients with adenine phosphoribosyltransferase deficiency showed similar histopathological findings regarding crystal morphology, crystal clearance, and renal injury. In mice, deletion of Tnfrl significantly reduced tubular CD44 and annexin two expression, as well as inflammation, thereby ameliorating the disease course. In contrast, genetic deletion of Tnfr2, Cd44, or Ahsg had no effect on the manifestations of 2,8-DHA nephropathy.\nConclusions Rodent models of the cellular and molecular mechanisms of 2,8-DHA nephropathy and crystal clearance have clinical relevance and offer insight into potential future targets for therapeutic interventions.",

      "abstractNote": "Single-nucleotide polymorphisms and locus amplification fink the NF-kappa B transcription factor c-Rel to human autoimmune diseases and B cell lymphomas, respectively. However, the functional consequences of enhanced c-Rel levels remain enigmatic. Here, we overexpressed c-Rel specifically in mouse B cells from BAC-transgenic gene loci and demonstrate that c-Rel protein levels linearly dictated expansion of germinal center B (GCB) cells and isotype-switched plasma cells. c-Rel expression in B cells of otherwise c-Rel-deficient mice fully rescued terminal B cell differentiation, underscoring its critical B cell-intrinsic roles. Unexpectedly, in GCB cells transcription-independent regulation produced the highest c-Rel protein levels among B cell subsets. In c-Rel-overexpressing GCB cells this caused enhanced nuclear translocation, a profoundly altered transcriptional program, and increased proliferation. Finally, we provide a link between c-Rel gain and autoimmunity by showing that c-Rel overexpression in B cells caused autoantibody production and renal immune complex deposition.",

      "abstractNote": "Introduction: Diabetes is a highly prevalent accelerator or even cause of chronic kidney disease imposing a large unmet medical need at the global scale. Massive research activities continue to be in search of a cure but the yield of the classical bench-to-bedside research approach has been low. We speculated that a significant mismatch in design and quality of animal and clinical studies in this domain is a hurdle for translation. Methods: We performed a meta-analysis of matched pairs of animal and human studies that tested the efficacy of distinct drug interventions for diabetic kidney disease (DKD). We reviewed study designs and reporting quality of such studies over the last decade according to the standards listed in the CONSORT and ARRIVE recommendations, respectively. Results: We noted a wide diversity in the study designs of animal studies in terms of diabetes induction. Major mismatches with the respective human studies referred to age and sex distribution, comorbidities, stage of the kidney disease, and selection of primary endpoints. Usually, treatment was initiated before onset of kidney disease without any standard of care as a background therapy. The reporting quality of animal studies was poor for randomization procedures, blinding, sample size calculation for a prespecified primary endpoint or the safety analysis. Reporting quality of clinical studies had deficits in trial design-, recruitment-, allocation-, and outcome-related aspects. Conclusion: Bench-to-bedside translation in the domain of DKD suffers from major deficits in the design of experimental studies in view of the projected clinical trials as well as from significant deficits in the reporting quality in preclinical and clinical studies.",

      "abstractNote": "Background. Dysbiosis, bacterial translocation and systemic inflammation have been found to be associated with human and experimental forms of chronic kidney disease (CKD), but the functional contribution of the intestinal microbiota to CKD-related intestinal barrier dysfunction and CKD progression is unknown, especially in CKD secondary to hyperoxaluria and nephrocalcinosis.\nMethods. C57BL/6N mice fed an oxalate-rich diet for either 10 or 20 days developed reversible or progressive kidney disease, respectively.\nResults. Oxalate-induced CKD manifested as azotaemia, renal anaemia and hyperkalaemia. CKD was associated with persistent dysbiosis and intestinal barrier dysfunction. Local as well as systemic inflammation was evident and partially persisted despite better renal function after returning to an oxalate-free diet, indicating some innate immune memory. Eradication of the microbiota with a combination of antibiotics improved intestinal barrier function but had no effect on renal function, nephrocalcinosis, kidney remodelling and atrophy compared with control mice not receiving antibiotics.\nConclusions. Together, in chronic oxalate nephropathy, the intestinal microbiota contributes to the CKD-related dysfunction of the intestinal barrier but not to the progression of nephrocalcinosis itself, as well to its related kidney atrophy and excretory dysfunction.",

      "abstractNote": "Podocytopathies are kidney diseases in which direct or indirect podocyte injury drives proteinuria or nephrotic syndrome. In children and young adults, genetic variants in >50 podocyte-expressed genes, syndromal non-podocyte-specific genes and phenocopies with other underlying genetic abnormalities cause podocytopathies associated with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome or severe proteinuria. A variety of genetic variants likely contribute to disease development. Among genes with non-Mendelian inheritance, variants in APOL1 have the largest effect size. In addition to genetic variants, environmental triggers such as immune-related, infection-related, toxic and haemodynamic factors and obesity are also important causes of podocyte injury and frequently combine to cause various degrees of proteinuria in children and adults. Typical manifestations on kidney biopsy are minimal change lesions and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis lesions. Standard treatment for primary podocytopathies manifesting with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis lesions includes glucocorticoids and other immunosuppressive drugs; individuals not responding with a resolution of proteinuria have a poor renal prognosis. Renin-angiotensin system antagonists help to control proteinuria and slow the progression of fibrosis. Symptomatic management may include the use of diuretics, statins, infection prophylaxis and anticoagulation. This Primer discusses a shift in paradigm from patient stratification based on kidney biopsy findings towards personalized management based on clinical, morphological and genetic data as well as pathophysiological understanding.",

      "title": "Effective methods to enhance medical students' cardioversion and transcutaneous cardiac pacing skills retention-a prospective controlled study",
      "abstractNote": "Background Guideline-based therapy of cardiac arrhythmias is important for many physicians from the beginning of their training. Practical training of the required skills to treat cardiac arrhythmias is useful for acquiring these skills but does not seem sufficient for skill retention. The aim of this study was to compare different retention methods for skills required to treat cardiac arrhythmias with respect to the performance of these skills in an assessment. Methods Seventy-one final-year medical students participated in a newly designed workshop to train synchronized cardioversion (SC) and transcutaneous cardiac pacing (TCP) skills in 2020. All participants completed an objective structured clinical examination (OSCE 1) one week after the training. Afterwards, the participants were stratified and randomized into three groups. Nine weeks later, one group received a standard operating procedure (SOP) for the skills, one group participated in a second workshop (SW), and one group received no further intervention (control). Ten weeks after the first training, all groups participated in OSCE 2. Results The average score of all students in OSCE 1 was 15.6 +/- 0.8 points with no significant differences between the three groups. Students in the control group reached a significantly (p < 0.001) lower score in OSCE 2 (-2.0 points, CI: [-2.9;-1.1]) than in OSCE 1. Students in the SOP-group achieved on average the same result in OSCE 2 as in OSCE 1 (0 points, CI: [-0.63;+0.63]). Students who completed a second skills training (SW-group) scored not significantly higher in OSCE 2 compared to OSCE 1 (+0.4 points, CI: [-0.29;+1.12]). The OSCE 2 scores in groups SOP and SW were neither significantly different nor statistically equivalent. Conclusions Partial loss of SC and TCP skills acquired in a workshop can be prevented after 10 weeks by reading an SOP as well as by a second workshop one week before the second assessment. Refreshing practical skills with an SOP could provide an effective and inexpensive method for skills retention compared to repeating a training. Further studies need to show whether this effect also exists for other skills and how frequently an SOP should be re-read for appropriate long-term retention of complex skills.",

      "abstractNote": "The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic influenced the management of patients with anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis. A paucity of data exists on outcome of patients with vasculitis following COVID-19, but mortality is higher than in the general population and comparable to patients undergoing haemodialysis or kidney transplant recipients (reported mortality rates of 20-25%). Delays in diagnosis have been reported, which are associated with sequelae such as dialysis-dependency. Management of ANCA-associated vasculitis has not changed with the aim to suppress disease activity and reduce burden of disease. The use of rituximab, an important and widely used agent, is associated with a more severe hospital course of COVID-19 and absence of antibodies following severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 infections, which prone patients to re-infection. Reports on vaccine antibody response are scarce at the moment, but preliminary findings point towards an impaired immune response, especially when patients receive rituximab as part of their treatment. Seropositivity was reported in less than 20% of patients when rituximab was administered within the prior six months, and the antibody response correlated with CD19+ B-cell repopulation. A delay in maintenance doses, if disease activity allows, has been suggested using a CD19+ B-cell guided strategy. Other immunosuppressive measures, which are used in ANCA-associated vasculitis, also impair humoral and cellular vaccine responses. Regular measurements of vaccine response or a healthcare-policy time-based strategy are indicated to provide additional doses (\"booster\") of COVID-19 vaccines. This review summarizes a recent educational forum and a recent virtual meeting of the European Vasculitis Society (EUVAS) focusing on COVID-19.",

      "title": "Recommendations for the use of COVID-19 vaccines in patients with immune-mediated kidney diseases",
      "abstractNote": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine platforms are becoming available and are the most promising strategy to curb the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infections. However, numerous uncertainties exist regarding the pros and cons of vaccination, especially in patients with (immune-mediated) kidney diseases on immunosuppressive drugs. Here, members of the Immunonephrology Working Group of the European Renal Association-European Dialysis and Transplant Association discuss 13 frequently asked questions regarding the safety and efficacy of the most promising vaccine candidates. Post-marketing surveillance should be performed to estimate the rate of vaccine response (humoral and cellular) of different vaccine platforms and disease activity following the administration of COVID-19 vaccines. Some of the candidates induce signalling pathways, which also promote autoimmune kidney diseases, e.g. type I interferons in systemic lupus erythematosus. Efficacy estimates would thus far favour the use of selected COVID-19 vaccines, such as BNT162b2, mRNA-1273 or Gam-COVID-Vac. Humoral immune response after vaccination should be monitored using appropriate assays. Even in the absence of neutralizing antibodies, patients might be protected by a sufficient cellular immune response capable of reducing the severity of COVID-19. A reduced vaccine response after the use of CD20-depleting agents is anticipated and it is particularly important to discuss strategies to improve vaccine response with these patients. Distancing and shielding measures remain important, as not all vaccines fully protect from coronavirus infection. In-depth information about the most pressing vaccine questions is essential to reduce vaccine hesitancy of patients.",

      "title": "Inflammatory Networks in Renal Cell Carcinoma",
      "abstractNote": "Simple Summary Inflammation is an important hallmark of advanced renal cell carcinoma and plays a pivotal role in tumor progression, metastasis, and anti-cancer resistance. Inflammation regulates the crosstalk between tumor cells and the surrounding tumor microenvironment, thereby promoting immune cell infiltration and release of inflammatory mediators and inducing immunosuppressive functions. Although inflammatory pathways sustain the function of renal cancer cells, the activatory effects are highly dependent on the immune cell landscape and the stage of RCC tumors. The aim of this review is to summarize the recent works describing the role of inflammation in the growth and metastasis of RCC tumors. This review also critically discusses the clinically relevant inflammatory pathways as potential targets for disease prevention and treatment. Cancer-associated inflammation has been established as a hallmark feature of almost all solid cancers. Tumor-extrinsic and intrinsic signaling pathways regulate the process of cancer-associated inflammation. Tumor-extrinsic inflammation is triggered by many factors, including infection, obesity, autoimmune disorders, and exposure to toxic and radioactive substances. Intrinsic inflammation can be induced by genomic mutation, genome instability and epigenetic remodeling in cancer cells that promote immunosuppressive traits, inducing the recruitment and activation of inflammatory immune cells. In RCC, many cancer cell-intrinsic alterations are assembled, upregulating inflammatory pathways, which enhance chemokine release and neoantigen expression. Furthermore, immune cells activate the endothelium and induce metabolic shifts, thereby amplifying both the paracrine and autocrine inflammatory loops to promote RCC tumor growth and progression. Together with tumor-extrinsic inflammatory factors, tumor-intrinsic signaling pathways trigger a Janus-faced tumor microenvironment, thereby simultaneously promoting or inhibiting tumor growth. For therapeutic success, it is important to understand the pathomechanisms of cancer-associated inflammation, which promote cancer progression. In this review, we describe the molecular mechanisms of cancer-associated inflammation that influence cancer and immune cell functions, thereby increasing tumor malignancy and anti-cancer resistance.

      "title": "No NLRP3 inflammasome activity in kidney epithelial cells, not even when the NLRP3-A350V Muckle-Wells variant is expressed in podocytes of diabetic mice",
      "abstractNote": "BackgroundThe NLRP3 inflammasome integrates several danger signals into the activation of innate immunity and inflammation by secreting IL-1 & beta; and IL-18. Most published data relate to the NLRP3 inflammasome in immune cells, but some reports claim similar roles in parenchymal, namely epithelial, cells. For example, podocytes, epithelial cells critical for the maintenance of kidney filtration, have been reported to express NLRP3 and to release IL-& beta; in diabetic kidney disease, contributing to filtration barrier dysfunction and kidney injury. We questioned this and hence performed independent verification experiments.MethodsWe studied the expression of inflammasome components in human and mouse kidneys and human podocytes using single-cell transcriptome analysis. Human podocytes were exposed to NLRP3 inflammasome agonists in vitro and we induced diabetes in mice with a podocyte-specific expression of the Muckle-Wells variant of NLRP3, leading to overactivation of the Nlrp3 inflammasome (Nphs2Cre;Nlrp3A350V) versus wildtype controls. Phenotype analysis included deep learning-based glomerular and podocyte morphometry, tissue clearing, and STED microscopy of the glomerular filtration barrier. The Nlrp3 inflammasome was blocked by feeding ss-hydroxy-butyrate.ResultsSingle-cell transcriptome analysis did not support relevant NLRP3 expression in parenchymal cells of the kidney. The same applied to primary human podocytes in which NLRP3 agonists did not induce IL-1 & beta; or IL-18 secretion. Diabetes induced identical glomerulomegaly in wildtype and Nphs2Cre;Nlrp3A350V mice but hyperfiltration-induced podocyte loss was attenuated and podocytes were larger in Nphs2Cre;Nlrp3A350V mice, an effect reversible with feeding the NLRP3 inflammasome antagonist ss-hydroxy-butyrate. Ultrastructural analysis of the slit diaphragm was genotype-independent hence albuminuria was identical.ConclusionPodocytes express low amounts of the NLRP3 inflammasome, if at all, and do not produce IL-1 & beta; and IL-18, not even upon introduction of the A350V Muckle-Wells NLRP3 variant and upon induction of podocyte stress. NLRP3-mediated glomerular inflammation is limited to immune cells.",

LN is characterized by glomerular deposition of immune complexes, leading to subendothelial, mesangial and subepithelial electron dense deposits, triggering immune cell infiltration and glomerular as well as tubulointerstitial injury. Monocytes and macrophages are abundantly present in inflammatory lesions, both in glomeruli and the tubulointerstitium. Here we discuss how monocytes and macrophages are involved in this process and how monocytes and macrophages may represent specific therapeutic targets to control LN.",

      "abstractNote": "Background Treatment with extracorporeal life support (ECLS) in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) complicated by cardiogenic shock (CS) fell short of improving myocardial recovery measured by 30 day ejection fraction in the ECLS-SHOCK trial. However, to date, no data regarding impact of ECLS on long-term outcomes exist.\nMethods In this randomized, controlled, prospective, open-label trial, 42 patients with CS complicating AMI were randomly assigned to ECLS (ECLS group, n = 21) or no ECLS (control group, n = 21). The primary endpoint was left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) after 30 days. Secondary endpoints included mortality and neurological outcome after 12 months. Evaluation of neurological outcome used the modified Rankin Scale.\nResults The 12-month all-cause mortality was 19% in the ECLS group versus 38% in the control group (p = 0.31). Only one patient (control group) died after the initial 30 days. Three patients underwent elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) during follow-up (one in the control and two in the ECLS group). Favorable neurological outcome (modified Rankin Score <= 2) was seen in 61.9% of patients in the ECLS group versus 57.1% in the control group (p = 1).\nConclusion This pilot study showed that randomized studies with ECLS in CS patients are feasible and safe. Small numbers of included patients impede meaningful conclusions about mortality and neurological outcome. Our findings of numerical differences in mortality and survival with severe neurological impairment give an urgent call for larger multi-centric randomized trials assessing the endpoint of all-cause mortality but also considering the effects on neurological outcome measures.",

      "abstractNote": "Background and objectives Nephrotic syndrome is a typical presentation of genetic podocytopathies but occasionally other genetic nephropathies can present as clinically indistinguishable phenocopies. We hypothesized that extended genetic testing followed by reverse phenotyping would increase the diagnostic rate for these patients.\nDesign, setting, participants,& measurements All patients diagnosed with nephrotic syndrome and referred to our center between 2000 and 2018 were assessed in this retrospective study. When indicated, whole-exome sequencing and in silico filtering of 298 genes related to CKD were combined with subsequent reverse phenotyping in patients and families. Pathogenic variants were defined according to current guidelines of the American College of Medical Genetics.\nResults A total of 111 patients (64 steroid-resistant and 47 steroid-sensitive) were included in the study. Not a single pathogenic variant was detected in the steroid-sensitive group. Overall, 30% (19 out of 64) of steroid-resistant patients had pathogenic variants in podocytopathy genes, whereas a substantial number of variants were identified in other genes, not commonly associated with isolated nephrotic syndrome. Reverse phenotyping, on the basis of a personalized diagnostic workflow, permitted to identify previously unrecognized clinical signs of an unexpected underlying genetic nephropathy in a further 28% (18 out of 64) of patients. These patients showed similar multidrug resistance, but different long-term outcome, when compared with genetic podocytopathies.\nConclusions Reverse phenotyping increased the diagnostic accuracy in patients referred with the diagnosis of steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome.",

      "abstractNote": "Hemozoin is an insoluble crystalline pigment produced by the malaria parasite Plasmodia upon digesting host hemoglobin inside red blood cells. Red blood cell rupture releases hemozoin crystals into the circulation from where they are cleared by phagocytes such as neutrophils. We speculated that plasma proteins would affect the ability of neutrophils to clear hemozoin crystals. To test this, we cultured human blood neutrophils with hemozoin ex vivo and found that neutrophils ingested hemozoin (0.1-1 mu m crystal size) in a dose-dependent manner into phagosomes and vesicles/vacuoles, resulting in morphological changes including nuclear enlargement, and vesicle formation, but not cell membrane rupture or release of neutrophil extracellular traps. The presence of human plasma significantly inhibited the ability of neutrophils to ingest hemozoin crystals. Platelet-poor plasma further inhibited the uptake of hemozoin by neutrophils. Selective exposure to fibrinogen completely replicated the plasma effect. Taken together, neutrophils cleared hemozoin crystals from the extracellular space via endocytosis into phagosomes and vesicles without inducing the release of neutrophil extracellular traps. However, human plasma components such as fibrinogen limited hemozoin clearance, whereas the presence of platelets augmented this process. These factors may influence the pro-inflammatory potential of hemozoin crystals in malaria.",

      "abstractNote": "In acute organ failure, rapid compensation of function loss assures survival. Dedifferentiation and/or proliferation of surviving parenchymal cells could imply a transient (and potentially fatal) impairment of residual functional performance. However, evolution has selected two flexible life-saving mechanisms acting synergistically on organ function recovery. Sustaining residual performance is possible when the remnant differentiated parenchymal cells avoid cell division, but increase function by undergoing hypertrophy via endoreplication, leading to polyploid cells. In addition, tissue progenitors, representing a subset of less-differentiated and/or self-renewing parenchymal cells completing cytokinesis, proliferate and differentiate to regenerate lost parenchymal cells. Here, we review the evolving evidence on polyploidization and progenitor-driven regeneration in acute liver, heart, and kidney failure with evolutionary advantages and trade-offs in organ repair.",

      "abstractNote": "Purpose of review Despite ground-breaking innovations for most autoimmune diseases, the treatment of lupus nephritis has remained largely the same for decades because none of the tested drugs demonstrated superiority over standard-of-care in randomized controlled clinical trials. Recent findings Recently, the Belimumab in Subjects with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus - Lupus Nephritis trial tested belimumab, an inhibitor of B-cell activating factor, as an add-on therapy to steroids and either mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) or cyclophosphamide when given IV monthly over a period of 104 weeks at an effect size of 11% for a Primary Efficacy Renal Response. The NOBILITY trial reported positive results for the B-cell-depleting agent obinutuzumab as an add-on therapy to steroids and MMF when given IV every 6 months over a period of 76 weeks at an effect size of 22% for a complete renal response (CRR). The AURORA trial reported positive results for the calcineurin inhibitor voclosporin as an oral add-on therapy to low dose steroids and MMF when given twice daily over a period of 52 weeks at an effect size of 18.5% for a CRR. These studies will change the treatment landscape of lupus nephritis. In which way is discussed in this article.",

      "abstractNote": "Alloantigen presentation is an essential process in acute allorejection. In this context, we speculated on a pathogenic role of cathepsin S (Cat-S), a cysteine protease known to promote antigenic peptide loading into MHC class II and to activate protease-activated receptor (PAR)-2 on intrarenal microvascular endothelial and tubular epithelial cells. Single-cell RNA sequencing and immunostaining of human kidney allografts confirmed Cat-S expression in intrarenal mononuclear phagocytes.In vitro, Cat-S inhibition suppressed CD4 + T cell lymphocyte activation in a mixed lymphocyte assay.In vivo, we employed a mouse model of kidney transplantation that showed preemptive Cat-S inhibition significantly protected allografts from tubulitis and intimal arteritis. To determine the contribution of PAR-2 activation, first, Balb/c donor kidneys were transplanted into Balb/c recipient mice without signs of rejection at day 10. In contrast, kidneys from C57BL/6J donor mice revealed severe intimal arteritis, tubulitis, interstitial inflammation, and glomerulitis. Kidneys fromPar2-deficient C57BL/6J mice revealed partial protection from tubulitis and lower intrarenal expression levels forFasl,Tnfa,Ccl5, andCcr5. Together, we conclude that Cat-S and PAR-2 contribute to immune dysregulation and kidney allograft rejection, possibly involving Cat-S-mediated activation of PAR-2 on recipient parenchymal cells in the allograft.",

      "abstractNote": "Inflammasome-driven release of interleukin(IL)-1 beta is a central element of many forms of sterile inflammation and has been evident to promote the onset and progression of diabetic kidney disease. We microdissected glomerular and tubulointerstitial samples from kidney biopsies of patients with diabetic kidney disease and found expression of IL-1 beta mRNA. Immunostaining of such kidney biopsies across a broad spectrum of diabetic kidney disease stages revealed IL-beta positivity in a small subset of infiltrating immune cell. Thus, we speculated on a potential of IL-1 beta as a therapeutic target and neutralizing the biological effects of murine IL-1 beta with a novel monoclonal antibody in uninephrectomized diabetic db/db mice with progressive type 2 diabetes- and obesity-related single nephron hyperfiltration, podocyte loss, proteinuria, and progressive decline of total glomerular filtration rate (GFR). At 18 weeks albuminuric mice were randomized to intraperitoneal injections with either anti-IL-1 beta or control IgG once weekly for 8 weeks. During this period, anti-IL-1 beta IgG had no effect on food or fluid intake, body weight, and fasting glucose levels. At week 26, anti-IL-1 beta IgG had reduced renal mRNA expression of kidney injury markers (Ngal) and fibrosis (Col1, a-Sma), significantly attenuated the progressive decline of GFR in hyperfiltrating diabetic mice, and preserved podocyte number without affecting albuminuria or indicators of single nephron hyperfiltration. No adverse effect were observed. Thus, IL-1 beta contributes to the progression of chronic kidney disease in type 2 diabetes and might therefore be a valuable therapeutic target, potentially in combination with drugs with different mechanisms-of-action such as RAS and SGLT2 inhibitors.",

      "abstractNote": "Data reproducibility and single-center bias are concerns in preclinical research and compromise translation from animal to human. Multicenter preclinical randomized controlled trials (pRCT) may reduce the gap between experimental studies and RCT and improve the predictability of results, for example Jak1/2 inhibition in lupus nephritis. To evaluate this, we conducted the first pRCT in the kidney domain at two Spanish and two German academic sites. Eligible MRL/MpJ-Fas(lpr) mice (female, age13-14 weeks, stress scores of less than two and no visible tumor or signs of infection) were equally randomized to either oral treatment with the Jak1/2 inhibitor baricitinib or vehicle for four weeks. Central blinded histology analysis was performed at an independent fifth site. The primary endpoint was the urinary protein/creatinine ratio. Baricitinib treatment did not significantly affect proteinuria, histological markers of activity and chronicity, or the glomerular filtration rate but significantly improved plasma autoantibody levels and lymphadenopathy. Data heterogeneity was noted across the different centers referring in part to phenotype differences between MRL/MpJ-Fas(lpr) mice bred at different sites, mimicking well patient phenotype diversity in lupus trials. Multicenter pRCT can overcome single-center bias at the cost of increasing variability and reducing effect size. Thus, our pRCT predicts a low effect size of baricitinib treatment on human lupus nephritis in heterogeneous study populations.",

      "abstractNote": "Lupus nephritis is a severe organ manifestation of systemic lupus erythematosus, and its pathogenesis involves complex etiology and mechanisms. Despite significant knowledge gains and extensive efforts put into understanding the development and relapsing disease activity, lupus nephritis remains a substantial cause of morbidity and mortality in lupus patients. Current therapies retain a significant unmet medical need regarding rates of complete response, preventing relapse of lupus nephritis, progression of chronic kidney disease to kidney failure, drug toxicity, and pill burden-related drug non-adherence. Connected to progression of chronic kidney disease are the associated risks for disabling or even lethal cardiovascular events, as well as chronic kidney disease -related secondary immunodeficiency and serious infections. In this regard, biomarkers are needed that can predict treatment response to specific drugs to enable personalized precision medicine. A series of clinical trials with innovative immunomodulatory drugs are ongoing and raise expectations for improvements in the management of lupus nephritis. Here, we review how new developments in pathogenesis connect with current and future perspectives for the management of lupus nephritis.",

      "abstractNote": "Post-ischemic acute kidney injury and disease (AKI/AKD) involve acute tubular necrosis and irreversible nephron loss. Mononuclear phagocytes including conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) are present during different phases of injury and repair, but the functional contribution of this subset remains controversial. Transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8) is required for the development of type I conventional dendritic cells (cDC1s) lineage and helps to define distinct cDC1 subsets. We identified one distinct subset among mononuclear phagocyte subsets according to the expression patterns of CD11b and CD11c in healthy kidney and lymphoid organs, of which IRF8 was significantly expressed in the CD11b(low)CD11c(high) subset that mainly comprised cDC1s. Next, we applied a Irf8-deficient mouse line (Irf8 (fl/fl) Clec9a (cre) mice) to specifically target Clec9a-expressing cDC1s in vivo. During post-ischemic AKI/AKD, these mice lacked cDC1s in the kidney without affecting cDC2s. The absence of cDC1s mildly aggravated the loss of living primary tubule and decline of kidney function, which was associated with decreased anti-inflammatory Tregs-related immune responses, but increased T helper type 1 (T-H1)-related and pro-inflammatory cytokines, infiltrating neutrophils and acute tubular cell death, while we also observed a reduced number of cytotoxic CD8(+) T cells in the kidney when cDC1s were absent. Together, our data show that IRF8 is indispensable for kidney cDC1s. Kidney cDC1s mildly protect against post-ischemic AKI/AKD, probably via suppressing tissue inflammation and damage, which implies an immunoregulatory role for cDC1s.",

      "title": "Novel Criteria for When and How to Exit a COVID-19 Pandemic Lockdown",
      "abstractNote": "In the first month of 2020, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel coronavirus spreading quickly via human-to-human transmission, caused the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Italy installed a successful nationwide lockdown to mitigate the exponential increase of case numbers, as the basic reproduction number R0 reached 1 within 4 weeks. But is R0 really the relevant criterion as to whether or not community spreading is under control? In most parts of the world, testing largely focused on symptomatic cases, and we thus hypothesized that the true number of infected cases and relative testing capacity are better determinants to guide lockdown exit strategies. We employed the SEIR model to estimate the numbers of undocumented cases. As expected, the estimated numbers of all cases largely exceeded the reported ones in all Italian regions. Next, we used the numbers of reported and estimated cases per million of population and compared it with the respective numbers of tests. In Lombardy, as the most affected region, testing capacity per reported new case seemed between two and eight most of the time, but testing capacity per estimated new cases never reached four up to April 30. In contrast, Veneto's testing capacity per reported and estimated new cases were much less discrepant and were between four and 16 most of the time. As per April 30 also Marche, Lazio and other Italian regions arrived close to 16 ratio of test capacity per new estimated infection. Thus, the criterion to exit a lockdown should be decided at the level of the regions, based on the local testing capacity that should reach 16 times the estimated true number of newly infected cases as predicted.",

      "abstractNote": "Growth and differentiation factor 15 (GDF15), a divergent member of the transforming growth factor-beta superfamily, has been associated with acute and chronic inflammatory conditions including autoimmune disease, i.e., type I diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis. Still, its role in systemic autoimmune disease remains elusive. Thus, we studied GDF15-deficient animals in Fas-receptor intact (C57BL/6) or deficient (C57BL/6(lpr/lpr)) backgrounds. Further, lupus nephritis (LN) microdissected kidney biopsy specimens were analyzed to assess the involvement of GDF15 in human disease. GDF15-deficiency in lupus-prone mice promoted lymphoproliferation, T-, B- and plasma cell-expansion, a type I interferon signature, and increased serum levels of anti-DNA autoantibodies. Accelerated systemic inflammation was found in association with a relatively mild renal phenotype. Splenocytes of phenotypically overall-normal Gdf15-/- C57BL/6 and lupus-prone C57BL/6(lpr/lpr) mice displayed increased in vitro lymphoproliferative responses or interferon-dependent transcription factor induction in response to the toll-like-receptor (TLR)-9 ligand CpG, or the TLR-7 ligand Imiquimod, respectively. In human LN, GDF15 expression was downregulated whereas type I interferon expression was upregulated in glomerular- and tubular-compartments versus living donor controls. These findings demonstrate that GDF15 regulates lupus-like autoimmunity by suppressing lymphocyte-proliferation and -activation. Further, the data indicate a negative regulatory role for GDF15 on TLR-7 and -9 driven type I interferon signaling in effector cells of the innate immune system.",

      "title": "IFN Regulatory Factor 4 Controls Post-ischemic Inflammation and Prevents Chronic Kidney Disease",
      "abstractNote": "Ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) of the kidney results in interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4)-mediated counter-regulation of the acute inflammatory response. Beyond that, IRF4 exerts important functions in controlling the cytokine milieu, T-cell differentiation, and macrophage polarization. The latter has been implicated in tissue remodeling. It therefore remains elusive what the role of IRF4 is in terms of long-term outcome following IRI. We hypothesized that an inability to resolve chronic inflammation in Irf4(-/-) mice would promote chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression. To evaluate the effects of IRF4 in chronic upon acute injury in vivo, a mouse model of chronic injury following acute IRI was employed. The expression of Irf4 increased within 10 days after IRI in renal tissue. Both mRNA and protein levels remained high up to 5 weeks upon IRI, suggesting a regulatory function in the chronic phase. Mice deficient in IRF4 display increased tubular cell loss and defective clearance of infiltrating macrophages. These phenomena were associated with increased expression of pro-inflammatory macrophage markers together with reduced expression of alternatively activated macrophage markers. In addition, IRF4-deficient mice showed defective development of alternatively activated macrophages. Hints of a residual M1 macrophage signature were further observed in human biopsy specimens of patients with hypertensive nephropathy vs. living donor specimens. Thus, IRF4 restricts CKD progression and kidney fibrosis following IRI, potentially by enabling M2 macrophage polarization and restricting a Th1 cytokine response. Deteriorated alternative macrophage subpopulations in Irf4(-/-) mice provoke chronic intrarenal inflammation, tubular epithelial cell loss, and renal fibrosis in the long course after IRI in mice. The clinical significance of these finding for human CKD remains uncertain at present and warrants further studies.",

      "title": "Nephron overload as a therapeutic target to maximize kidney lifespan",
      "abstractNote": "Kidney lifespan is a patient-oriented outcome that provides much needed context for understanding chronic kidney disease (CKD). Nephron endowment, age-associated decline in nephron number, kidney injury history and the intrinsic capacity of nephrons to adapt to haemodynamic and metabolic overload vary widely within the population. Defining percentiles of kidney function might therefore help to predict individual kidney lifespan and distinguish healthy ageing from progressive forms of CKD. In response to nephron loss, the remaining nephrons undergo functional and structural adaptations to meet the ongoing haemodynamic and metabolic demands of the organism. When these changes are no longer sufficient to maintain kidney cell homeostasis, remnant nephron demise occurs and CKD progression ensues. An individual's trajectory of glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria reflects the extent of nephron loss and adaptation of the remaining nephrons. Nephron overload represents the final common pathway of CKD progression and is largely independent of upstream disease mechanisms. Thus, interventions that efficiently attenuate nephron overload in early disease stages can protect remnant kidney cells and nephrons, and delay CKD progression. This Review provides a conceptual framework for individualized diagnosis, monitoring and treatment of CKD with the goal of maximizing kidney lifespan.",

      "abstractNote": "Background Cholesterol crystal (CC) embolism causes acute kidney injury (AKI) and ischaemic cortical necrosis associated with high mortality. We speculated that sustaining the fibrinolytic system with Glu-plasminogen (Glu-Plg) could be a safe way to attenuate AKI and prevent ischaemic infarction upon CC embolism. Methods We induced CC embolism by injecting CC into the left kidney artery of C57BL/6J mice. The primary endpoint was glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Results Starting as early as 2 h after CC embolism, thrombotic angiopathy progressed gradually in the interlobular, arcuate and interlobar arteries. This was associated with a decrease of GFR reaching a peak at 18 h, i.e. AKI, and progressive ischaemic kidney necrosis developing between 12-48 h after CC injection. Human plasma Glu-Plg extracts injected intravenously 4 h after CC embolism attenuated thrombotic angiopathy, GFR loss as well as ischaemic necrosis in a dose-dependent manner. No bleeding complications occurred after Glu-Plg injection. Injection of an intermediate dose (0.6 mg/kg) had only a transient protective effect on microvascular occlusions lasting for a few hours without a sustained protective effect on AKI at 18-48 h or cortical necrosis, while 1.5 mg/kg were fully protective. Importantly, no bleeding complications occurred. Conclusions These results provide the first experimental evidence that Glu-Plg could be an innovative therapeutic strategy to attenuate thrombotic angiopathy, AKI, kidney necrosis and potentially other clinical manifestations of CC embolism syndrome.",

      "abstractNote": "Calcium oxalate (CaOx) crystal formation, aggregation and growth is a common cause of kidney stone disease and nephrocalcinosis-related chronic kidney disease (CKD). Genetically modified mouse strains are frequently used as an experimental tool in this context but observed phenotypes may also relate to the genetic background or intestinal microbiota. We hypothesized that the genetic background or intestinal microbiota of mice determine CaOx crystal deposition and thus the outcome of nephrocalcinosis. Indeed, Casp1 (-/-), Cybb (-/-) or Casp1 (-/-)/Cybb (-/-) knockout mice on a 129/C57BL/6J (B6J) background that were fed an oxalate-rich diet for 14 days did neither encounter intrarenal CaOx crystal deposits nor nephrocalcinosis-related CKD. To test our assumption, we fed C57BL/6N (B6N), 129, B6J and Balb/c mice an oxalate-rich diet for 14 days. Only B6N mice displayed CaOx crystal deposits and developed CKD associated with tubular injury, inflammation and interstitial fibrosis. Intrarenal mRNA expression profiling of 64 known nephrocalcinosis-related genes revealed that healthy B6N mice had lower mRNA levels of uromodulin (Umod) compared to the other three strains. Feeding an oxalate-rich diet caused an increase in uromodulin protein expression and CaOx crystal deposition in the kidney as well as in urinary uromodulin excretion in B6N mice but not 129, B6J and Balb/c mice. However, backcrossing 129 mice on a B6N background resulted in a gradual increase in CaOx crystal deposits from F2 to F7, of which all B6N/129 mice from the 7(th) generation developed CaOx-related nephropathy similar to B6N mice. Co-housing experiments tested for a putative role of the intestinal microbiota but B6N co-housed with 129 mice or B6N/129 (3(rd) and 6(th) generation) mice did not affect nephrocalcinosis. In summary, genetic background but not the intestinal microbiome account for strain-specific crystal formation and, the levels of uromodulin secretion may contribute to this phenomenon. Our results imply that only littermate controls of the identical genetic background strain are appropriate when performing knockout mouse studies in this context, while co-housing is optional.",

      "abstractNote": "Extracellular DNA may serve as marker in liquid biopsies to determine individual diagnosis and prognosis in cancer patients. Cell death or active release from various cell types, including immune cells can result in the release of DNA into the extracellular milieu. Neutrophils are important components of the innate immune system, controlling pathogens through phagocytosis and/or the release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). NETs also promote tumor progression and metastasis, by modulating angiogenesis, anti-tumor immunity, blood clotting and inflammation and providing a supportive niche for metastasizing cancer cells. Besides neutrophils, other immune cells such as eosinophils, dendritic cells, monocytes/macrophages, mast cells, basophils and lymphocytes can also form extracellular traps (ETs) during cancer progression, indicating possible multiple origins of extracellular DNA in cancer. In this review, we summarize the pathomechanisms of ET formation generated by different cell types, and analyze these processes in the context of cancer. We also critically discuss potential ET-inhibiting agents, which may open new therapeutic strategies for cancer prevention and treatment.",

      "abstractNote": "Clinicians often have to make treatment decisions based on the likelihood that individual patients will receive benefit. This information has to be derived from appropriate studies and provided in a way that easily transforms from the statistical model into clinical practice. This chapter discusses four methodological strategies to provide information for treatment decisions: subgroup analysis, regression models, models for potential outcome, and prediction models. Based on how statistical techniques are able to provide information for stratified, precision, or individualized medicine we present the challenges that exist in analysis, reporting and applying those results. We also identify relevant ethical issues. There is still a substantial gap between formal statistical results on patient treatment interaction and ways in which they can be presented to clinicians as easy to use tools in clinical decision-making. At the moment, most energy is spent in the discovery of biomarkers which help to grasp patient treatment interaction. Less energy is spent in corresponding validation studies and the process of translating statistical results into clinical practice. Furthermore, clinical studies that provide evidence for successful translation of predictive biomarkers into clinical practice are needed.",

      "abstractNote": "Background: There is a need for biomarker to identify patients \"at risk\" for rheumatoid arthritis (risk-RA) and to better predict the therapeutic response and in this study we tested the hypothesis that novel native and citrullinated heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP)-DL autoantibodies could be possible biomarkers.\nMethods: Using protein macroarray and ELISA, epitope recognition against hnRNP-DL was analysed in sera from different developed RA disease and diagnosed SLE patients. Toll-like receptor (TLR) 7/9 and myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88)-dependency were studied in sera from murine disease models. HnRNP-DL expression in cultivated cells and synovial tissue was analysed by indirect immunofluorescence, immunoblot and immunohistochemistry.\nResults: HnRNP-DL was highly expressed in stress granules, citrullinated in the rheumatoid joint and targeted by autoantibodies either as native or citrullinated proteins in patient subsets with different developed RA disease. Structural citrullination dependent epitopes (SCEs) of hnRNP-DL were detected in 58% of the SLE patients although 98% of these sera were alpha-CCP-2-negative. To obtain a specific citrullinated signal value, we subtracted the native antibody value from the citrullinated signal. The citrullinated/native index of autoantibodies against hnRNP-DL (CNDL-Index) was identified as a new value for an \"individual window of treatment success\" in early RA and for the detection of RF IgM/alpha-CCP-2 seronegative RA patients (24-46%). Negative CNDL-index was found in SLE patients, risk-RA and early RA cohorts such as EIRA where the majority of these patients are DAS28-responders to methotrexate (MTX) treatment (87%). High positive CNDL-values were associated with more severe RA, shared epitope and parenchymal changes in the lung.

      "abstractNote": "Although monosodium urate (MSU) crystals are known to trigger inflammation, published data on soluble uric acid (sUA) in this context are discrepant. We hypothesized that diverse sUA preparation methods account for this discrepancy and that an animal model with clinically relevant levels of asymptomatic hyperuricemia and gouty arthritis can ultimately clarify this issue. To test this, we cultured human monocytes with different sUA preparation solutions and found that solubilizing uric acid (UA) by prewarming created erroneous results because of UA microcrystal contaminants triggering IL-1 beta release. Solubilizing UA with NaOH avoided this artifact, and this microcrystal-free preparation suppressed LPS- or MSU crystal-induced monocyte activation, a process depending on the intracellular uptake of sUA via the urate transporter SLC2A9/GLUT9. CD14(+) monocytes isolated from hyperuricemic patients were less responsive to inflammatory stimuli compared with monocytes from healthy individuals. Treatment with plasma from hyperuricemic patients impaired the inflammatory function of CD14(+) monocytes, an effect fully reversible by removing sUA from hyperuricemic plasma. Moreover, Alb-creERT2;Glut9(lox/lox) mice with hyperuricemia (serum UA of 9-11 mg/di) showed a suppressed inflammatory response to MSU crystals compared with Glut9(lox/lox) controls without hyperuricemia. Taken together, we unravel a technical explanation for discrepancies in the published literature on immune effects of sUA and identify hyperuricemia as an intrinsic suppressor of innate immunity, in which sUA modulates the capacity of monocytes to respond to danger signals. Thus, sUA is not only a substrate for the formation of MSU crystals but also an intrinsic inhibitor of MSU crystal-induced tissue inflammation.",

      "abstractNote": "Neutrophils are key players during host defense and sterile inflammation. Neutrophil dysfunction is a characteristic feature of the acquired immunodeficiency during kidney disease. We speculated that the impaired renal clearance of the intrinsic purine metabolite soluble uric acid (sUA) may account for neutrophil dysfunction. Indeed, hyperuricemia (HU, serum UA of 9-12 mg/dL) related or unrelated to kidney dysfunction significantly diminished neutrophil adhesion and extravasation in mice with crystal- and coronavirusrelated sterile inflammation using intravital microscopy and an air pouch model. This impaired neutrophil recruitment was partially reversible by depleting UA with rasburicase. We validated these findings in vitro using either neutrophils or serum from patients with kidney dysfunction-related HU with or without UA depletion, which partially normalized the defective migration of neutrophils. Mechanistically, sUA impaired beta(2) integrin activity and internalization/recycling by regulating intracellular pH and cytoskeletal dynamics, physiological processes that are known to alter the migratory and phagocytic capability of neutrophils. This effect was fully reversible by blocking intracellular uptake of sUA via urate transporters. In contrast, sUA had no effect on neutrophil extracellular trap formation in neutrophils from healthy subjects or patients with kidney dysfunction. Our results identify an unexpected immunoregulatory role of the intrinsic purine metabolite sUA, which contrasts the well-known immunostimulatory effects of crystalline UA. Specifically targeting UA may help to overcome certain forms of immunodeficiency, for example in kidney dysfunction, but may enhance sterile forms of inflammation.",

      "abstractNote": "Environmental changes can induce diversity shifts within ecosystems that affect interactions between species. Similarly, the development of kidney disease induces shifts within the ecosystem of the intestinal microbiome, affecting host physiology and fitness. Renal failure itself, together with related changes in diet and medication, alters the microbiota and its secretome of micronutrients, nutrients and regulatory metabolites towards a phenotype characterized by the production of uraemic toxins, hence contributing to the clinical syndrome of uraemia and its complications. These alterations are associated with structural changes in the intestinal wall that impair barrier function and cause leakage of bacterial metabolites, bacterial wall products and live bacteria into the circulation. Thus, the intestinal microbiota represents a new therapeutic target to improve outcomes of chronic kidney disease (CKD), including symptoms of uraemia, metabolic changes, cardiovascular complications, aberrant immunity and disease progression. Initial interventional studies have shown promising effects of unselective probiotic preparations on kidney inflammation and uraemia in patients with CKD but longer-term studies are needed. Here, we take an ecological approach to understand the role of the intestinal microbiota in determining survival fitness in kidney disease.",

      "abstractNote": "Crescentic glomerulonephritis is characterized by vascular necrosis and parietal epithelial cell hyperplasia in the space surrounding the glomerulus, resulting in the formation of crescents. Little is known about the molecular mechanisms driving this process. Inducing crescentic glomerulonephritis in two Pax2Cre reporter mouse models revealed that crescents derive from clonal expansion of single immature parietal epithelial cells. Preemptive and delayed histone deacetylase inhibition with panobinostat, a drug used to treat hematopoietic stem cell disorders, attenuated crescentic glomerulonephritis with recovery of kidney function in the two mouse models. Three-dimensional confocal microscopy and stimulated emission depletion superresolution imaging of mouse glomeruli showed that, in addition to exerting an anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effect, panobinostat induced differentiation of an immature hyperplastic parietal epithelial cell subset into podocytes, thereby restoring the glomerular filtration barrier. Single-cell RNA sequencing of human renal progenitor cells in vitro identified an immature stratifin-positive cell subset and revealed that expansion of this stratifin-expressing progenitor cell subset was associated with a poor outcome in human crescentic glomerulonephritis. Treatment of human parietal epithelial cells in vitro with panobinostat attenuated stratifin expression in renal progenitor cells, reduced their proliferation, and promoted their differentiation into podocytes. These results offer mechanistic insights into the formation of glomerular crescents and demonstrate that selective targeting of renal progenitor cells can attenuate crescent formation and the deterioration of kidney function in crescentic glomerulonephritis in mice.",

      "abstractNote": "Growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) is a member of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) cytokine family and an inflammation-associated protein. Here, we investigated the role of GDF15 in murine anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) glomerulonephritis. Glomerulonephritis induction in mice induced systemic expression of GDF15. Moreover, we demonstrate the protective effects for GDF15, as GDF15-deficient mice exhibited increased proteinuria with an aggravated crescent formation and mesangial expansion in anti-GBM nephritis. Herein, GDF15 was required for the regulation of T-cell chemotactic chemokines in the kidney. In addition, we found the upregulation of the CXCR3 receptor in activated T-cells in GDF15-deficient mice. These data indicate that CXCL10/CXCR3-dependent-signaling promotes the infiltration of T cells into the organ during acute inflammation controlled by GDF15. Together, these results reveal a novel mechanism limiting the migration of lymphocytes to the site of inflammation during glomerulonephritis.",

      "abstractNote": "Background Progression of CKD in type 2 diabetes, despite dual inhibition of sodium-glucose transporter-2 and the renin-angiotensin system, remains a concern. Bromoindirubin-3'-oxime (BIO), previously reported to promote podocyte survival and regeneration, is a candidate additional drug to elicit renoprotective effects beyond therapy with metformin, ramipril, and empagliflozin (MRE). Evaluating a drug with standard therapeutics more closely mimics the clinical setting than evaluating the drug alone.\nMethods Uninephrectomized BKS-Lepr-/- (db/db) mice treated with or without MRE served as a model of progressive CKD in type 2 diabetes. Mice on or off MRE were randomized to only 4 weeks of add-on BIO or vehicle. The primary end point was slope of GFR (Delta GFR).\nResults Four weeks of MRE treatment alone did not affect Delta GFR, but significantly attenuated hyperglycemia, albuminuria, and glomerulosclerosis and increased podocyte filtration slit density, as assessed by STED super-resolution microscopy upon tissue clearing. BIO alone improved albuminuria, podocyte density in superficial and juxtamedullary nephrons, and podocyte filtration slit density. MRE+BIO combination therapy had additive protective effects on Delta GFR, glomerulosclerosis, podocyte density in juxtamedullary nephrons, and filtration slit density.\nConclusions Add-on treatment with BIO for only 4 weeks attenuates progression of CKD beyond MRE therapy in mice with type 2 diabetes. Additional drug combinations may help to further delay ESKD in type 2 diabetes.",

      "title": "Management of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis with glomerulonephritis as proposed by the ACR 2021, EULAR 2022 and KDIGO 2021 guidelines/recommendations",
      "abstractNote": "Updated guidelines on the management of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) were released in 2021 by the American College of Rheumatology jointly with the Vasculitis Foundation and, subsequently, in 2022 by the European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology. In addition, in 2021, the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes had released updated recommendations on the treatment of AAV with glomerulonephritis (AAV-GN). Kidney involvement is particularly relevant in microscopic polyangiitis and granulomatosis with polyangiitis, but is less frequent in eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis. The management of AAV-GN has been a focus for drug development and change over the past 10 years. Avoidance of progression to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) or kidney failure is one of the main unmet needs in the management of AAV, with ESKD having a major impact on morbidity, health costs and mortality risk. Relevant changes in AAV-GN management are related to remission-induction treatment of patients with severe kidney disease, the use of glucocorticoids and avacopan, and remission-maintenance treatment. All the documents provide guidance in accordance with the evidence-based standard of care available at the time of their release. With our work we aim to (i) show the progress made and identify the differences between guidelines and recommendations, (ii) discuss the supporting rationale for those, and (iii) identify gaps in knowledge that could benefit from additional research and should be revised in subsequent updates.",

      "abstractNote": "Crystals and nano- and microparticles form inside the human body from intrinsic proteins, minerals, or metabolites or enter the body as particulate matter from occupational and environmental sources. Associated tissue injuries and diseases mostly develop from cellular responses to such crystal deposits and include inflammation, cell necrosis, granuloma formation, tissue fibrosis, and stone-related obstruction of excretory organs. But how do crystals and nano- and microparticles trigger these biological processes? Which pathomechanisms are identical across different particle types, sizes, and shapes? In addition, which mechanisms are specific to the atomic or molecular structure of crystals or to specific sizes or shapes? Do specific cellular or molecular mechanisms qualify as target for therapeutic interventions? Here, we provide a guide to approach this diverse and multidisciplinary research domain. We give an overview about the clinical spectrum of crystallopathies, about shared and specific pathomechanisms as a conceptual overview before digging deeper into the specialty field of interest.",

      "title": "Mitochondria Permeability Transition versus Necroptosis in Oxalate-Induced AKI",
      "abstractNote": "Background Serum oxalate levels suddenly increase with certain dietary exposures or ethylene glycol poisoning and are a well known cause of AKI. Established contributors to oxalate crystal-induced renal necroinflammation include the NACHT, LRR and PYD domains-containing protein-3 (NLRP3) inflamma-some and mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL) protein-dependent tubule necroptosis. These studies examined the role of a novel form of necrosis triggered by altered mitochondrial function.\nMethods To better understand the molecular pathophysiology of oxalate-induced AIK, we conducted in vitro studies in mouse and human kidney cells and in vivo studies in mice, including wild-type mice and knockout mice deficient in peptidylprolyl isomerase F (Ppif) or deficient in both Ppif and Mlkl.\nResults Crystals of calcium oxalate, monosodium urate, or calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate, as well as silica microparticles, triggered cell necrosis involving PPIF-dependent mitochondrial permeability transition. This process involves crystal phagocytosis, lysosomal cathepsin leakage, and increased release of reactive oxygen species. Mice with acute oxalosis displayed calcium oxalate crystals inside distal tubular epithelial cells associated with mitochondrial changes characteristic of mitochondrial permeability transition. Mice lacking Ppif or MIkI or given an inhibitor of mitochondrial permeability transition displayed attenuated oxalate-induced AKI. Dual genetic deletion of Ppif and Mlkl or pharmaceutical inhibition of necroptosis was partially redundant, implying interlinked roles of these two pathways of regulated necrosis in acute oxalosis. Similarly, inhibition of mitochondrial permeability transition suppressed crystal-induced cell death in primary human tubular epithelial cells. PPIF and phosphorylated MLKL localized to injured tubules in diagnostic human kidney biopsies of oxalosis-related AKI.\nConclusions Mitochondrial permeability transition-related regulated necrosis and necroptosis both contribute to oxalate-induced AKI, identifying PPIF as a potential molecular target for renoprotective intervention.",

      "title": "Response Surface Analysis With Multilevel Data: Illustration for the Case of Congruence Hypotheses",
      "abstractNote": "Response surface analysis (RSA) is a statistical approach that enables researchers to test congruence hypotheses; the proposition that the degree of congruence between people's values in 2 psychological constructs should be positively or negatively related to their value in an outcome variable. This is done by estimating a polynomial regression model and using the graph of the model and several parameters as a guide to interpret the resulting regression coefficients in terms of the congruence hypothesis. One problem with using RSA in applied research is that the model and the interpretation of the model's parameters in terms of congruence effects have only been thoroughly developed for single-level data. Here, we present an extension of RSA to multilevel data. Among other things we show how the standard errors can be computed and how researchers can decide whether the occurrence of a congruence effect depends on a Level 2 covariate. We illustrate the suggested extension with 2 examples that guide readers through the test of congruence effects in the case of multilevel data. We also provide R scripts that researchers can adopt to conduct multilevel RSA.\nTranslational Abstract\nMany psychological theories propose that the amount of congruence between two psychological variables is related to an outcome variable (e.g., that the congruence between competence demands of a person's job and the person's competence relates to job satisfaction). The present article introduces an extension of RSA that can be applied to multilevel data and provide R scripts to facilitate these analyses. The suggested approach allows researchers to examine their congruence hypotheses and other RSA effects when they have multilevel data.",

      "abstractNote": "The constant development of new data analysis methods in many fields of research is accompanied by an increasing awareness that these new methods often perform better in their introductory paper than in subsequent comparison studies conducted by other researchers. We attempt to explain this discrepancy by conducting a systematic experiment that we call \"cross-design validation of methods\". In the experiment, we select two methods designed for the same data analysis task, reproduce the results shown in each paper, and then reevaluate each method based on the study design (i.e., datasets, competing methods, and evaluation criteria) that was used to show the abilities of the other method. We conduct the experiment for two data analysis tasks, namely cancer subtyping using multiomic data and differential gene expression analysis. Three of the four methods included in the experiment indeed perform worse when they are evaluated on the new study design, which is mainly caused by the different datasets. Apart from illustrating the many degrees of freedom existing in the assessment of a method and their effect on its performance, our experiment suggests that the performance discrepancies between original and subsequent papers may not only be caused by the nonneutrality of the authors proposing the new method but also by differences regarding the level of expertise and field of application. Authors of new methods should thus focus not only on a transparent and extensive evaluation but also on comprehensive method documentation that enables the correct use of their methods in subsequent studies.",

      "title": "Over-optimism in benchmark studies and the multiplicity of design and analysis options when interpreting their results",
      "abstractNote": "In recent years, the need for neutral benchmark studies that focus on the comparison of methods coming from computational sciences has been increasingly recognized by the scientific community. While general advice on the design and analysis of neutral benchmark studies can be found in recent literature, a certain flexibility always exists. This includes the choice of data sets and performance measures, the handling of missing performance values, and the way the performance values are aggregated over the data sets. As a consequence of this flexibility, researchers may be concerned about how their choices affect the results or, in the worst case, may be tempted to engage in questionable research practices (e.g., the selective reporting of results or the post hoc modification of design or analysis components) to fit their expectations. To raise awareness for this issue, we use an example benchmark study to illustrate how variable benchmark results can be when all possible combinations of a range of design and analysis options are considered. We then demonstrate how the impact of each choice on the results can be assessed using multidimensional unfolding. In conclusion, based on previous literature and on our illustrative example, we claim that the multiplicity of design and analysis options combined with questionable research practices lead to biased interpretations of benchmark results and to over-optimistic conclusions. This issue should be considered by computational researchers when designing and analyzing their benchmark studies and by the scientific community in general in an effort towards more reliable benchmark results.

      "title": "Relationship between age at initiation of cysteamine treatment, adherence with therapy, and glomerular kidney function in infantile nephropathic cystinosis",
      "abstractNote": "Infantile nephropathic cystinosis, due to impaired transport of cystine out of lysosomes, occurs with an incidence of 1 in 100-200,000 live births. It is characterized by renal Fanconi syndrome in the first year of life and glomer-ular dysfunction progression to end-stage kidney disease by approximately 10 years of age. Treatment with oral cysteamine therapy helps preserve glomerular function, but affected individuals eventually require kidney re-placement therapy. This is because glomerular damage had already occurred by the time a child is diagnosed with cystinosis, typically in the second year of life. We performed a retrospective multicenter study to investigate the impact of initiating cysteamine treatment within the first 2 months of life in some infants and comparing two different levels of adherence in patients diagnosed at the typical age. We collected 3983 data points from 55 patients born between 1997 and 2020; 52 patients with 1592 data points could be further evaluated. These data were first analyzed by dividing the patient cohort into three groups: (i) standard treatment start with good adherence, (ii) standard treatment start with less good adherence, and (iii) early treatment start. At every age, mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was higher in early-treated patients than in later-treated patients. Second, a generalized additive mixed model (GAMM) was applied showing that patients with initiation of treatment before 2 months of age are expected to have a 34 ml/min/1.73 m(2) higher eGFR than patients with later treatment start while controlling for adherence and patients' age. These data strongly suggest that oral cysteamine treatment initiated within 2 months of birth preserves kidney function in infantile nephropathic cystinosis and provide evidence of the utility of newborn screening for this disease.

If findings are not replicable, then prediction and theory development are stifled. If findings are replicable, then interrogation of their meaning and validity can advance knowledge. Assessing replicability can be productive for generating and testing hypotheses by actively confronting current understandings to identify weaknesses and spur innovation. For psychology, the 2010s might be characterized as a decade of active confrontation. Systematic and multi-site replication projects assessed current understandings and observed surprising failures to replicate many published findings. Replication efforts highlighted sociocultural challenges such as disincentives to conduct replications and a tendency to frame replication as a personal attack rather than a healthy scientific practice, and they raised awareness that replication contributes to self-correction. Nevertheless, innovation in doing and understanding replication and its cousins, reproducibility and robustness, has positioned psychology to improve research practices and accelerate progress.",

      "abstractNote": "Content-based techniques for credibility assessment (Criteria-Based Content Analysis [CBCA], Reality Monitoring [RM]) have been shown to distinguish between experience-based and fabricated statements in previous meta-analyses. New simulations raised the question whether these results are reliable revealing that using meta-analytic methods on biased datasets lead to false-positive rates of up to 100%. By assessing the performance of and applying different bias-correcting meta-analytic methods on a set of 71 studies we aimed for more precise effect size estimates. According to the sole bias-correcting meta-analytic method that performed well under a priori specified boundary conditions, CBCA and RM distinguished between experience-based and fabricated statements. However, great heterogeneity limited precise point estimation (i.e., moderate to large effects). In contrast, Scientific Content Analysis (SCAN)-another content-based technique tested-failed to discriminate between truth and lies. It is discussed how the gap between research on and forensic application of content-based credibility assessment may be narrowed.",

      "abstractNote": "Acute tissue injury causes DNA damage and repair processes involving increased cell mitosis and polyploidization, leading to cell function alterations that may potentially drive cancer development. Here, we show that acute kidney injury (AKI) increased the risk for papillary renal cell carcinoma (pRCC) development and tumor relapse in humans as confirmed by data collected from several single-center and multicentric studies. Lineage tracing of tubular epithelial cells (TECs) after AKI induction and long-term follow-up in mice showed time-dependent onset of clonal papillary tumors in an adenoma-carcinoma sequence. Among AKI-related pathways, NOTCH1 overexpression in human pRCC associated with worse outcome and was specific for type 2 pRCC. Mice overexpressing NOTCH1 in TECs developed papillary adenomas and type 2 pRCCs, and AKI accelerated this process. Lineage tracing in mice identified single renal progenitors as the cell of origin of papillary tumors. Single-cell RNA sequencing showed that human renal progenitor transcriptome showed similarities to PT1, the putative cell of origin of human pRCC. Furthermore, NOTCH1 overexpression in cultured human renal progenitor cells induced tumor-like 3D growth. Thus, AKI can drive tumorigenesis from local tissue progenitor cells. In particular, we find that AKI promotes the development of pRCC from single progenitors through a classical adenoma-carcinoma sequence.",

      "title": "From kidney injury to kidney cancer",
      "abstractNote": "Epidemiologic studies document strong associations between acute or chronic kidney injury and kidney tumors. However, whether these associations are linked by causation, and in which direction, is unclear. Accumulating data from basic and clinical research now shed light on this issue and prompt us to propose a new pathophysiological concept with immanent implications in the management of patients with kidney disease and patients with kidney tumors. As a central paradigm, this review proposes the mechanisms of kidney damage and repair that are active during acute kidney injury but also during persistent injuries in chronic kidney disease as triggers of DNA damage, promoting the expansion of (pre-)malignant cell clones. As renal progenitors have been identified by different studies as the cell of origin for several benign and malignant kidney tumors, we discuss how the different types of kidney tumors relate to renal progenitors at specific sites of injury and to germline or somatic mutations in distinct signaling pathways. We explain how known risk factors for kidney cancer rather represent risk factors for kidney injury as an upstream cause of cancer. Finally, we propose a new role for nephrologists in kidney cancer (i.e., the primary and secondary prevention and treatment of kidney injury to reduce incidence, prevalence, and recurrence of kidney cancer).",

      "title": "NetCoMi: network construction and comparison for microbiome data in R",
      "abstractNote": "Motivation: Estimating microbial association networks from high-throughput sequencing data is a common exploratory data analysis approach aiming at understanding the complex interplay of microbial communities in their natural habitat. Statistical network estimation workflows comprise several analysis steps, including methods for zero handling, data normalization and computing microbial associations. Since microbial interactions are likely to change between conditions, e.g. between healthy individuals and patients, identifying network differences between groups is often an integral secondary analysis step. Thus far, however, no unifying computational tool is available that facilitates the whole analysis workflow of constructing, analysing and comparing microbial association networks from high-throughput sequencing data. Results: Here, we introduce NetCoMi (Network Construction and comparison for Microbiome data), an R package that integrates existing methods for each analysis step in a single reproducible computational workflow. The package offers functionality for constructing and analysing single microbial association networks as well as quantifying network differences. This enables insights into whether single taxa, groups of taxa or the overall network structure change between groups. NetCoMi also contains functionality for constructing differential networks, thus allowing to assess whether single pairs of taxa are differentially associated between two groups. Furthermore, NetCoMi facilitates the construction and analysis of dissimilarity networks of microbiome samples, enabling a high-level graphical summary of the heterogeneity of an entire microbiome sample collection. We illustrate NetCoMi's wide applicability using data sets from the GABRIELA study to compare microbial associations in settled dust from children's rooms between samples from two study centers (Ulm and Munich).",

      "title": "Hyperparameters and tuning strategies for random forest",
      "abstractNote": "The random forest (RF) algorithm has several hyperparameters that have to be set by the user, for example, the number of observations drawn randomly for each tree and whether they are drawn with or without replacement, the number of variables drawn randomly for each split, the splitting rule, the minimum number of samples that a node must contain, and the number of trees. In this paper, we first provide a literature review on the parameters' influence on the prediction performance and on variable importance measures. It is well known that in most cases RF works reasonably well with the default values of the hyperparameters specified in software packages. Nevertheless, tuning the hyperparameters can improve the performance of RF. In the second part of this paper, after a presenting brief overview of tuning strategies, we demonstrate the application of one of the most established tuning strategies, model-based optimization (MBO). To make it easier to use, we provide the tuneRanger R package that tunes RF with MBO automatically. In a benchmark study on several datasets, we compare the prediction performance and runtime of tuneRanger with other tuning implementations in R and RF with default hyperparameters.

      "abstractNote": "Modern supervised machine learning algorithms involve hyperparameters that have to be set before running them. Options for setting hyperparameters are default values from the software package, manual configuration by the user or configuring them for optimal predictive performance by a tuning procedure. The goal of this paper is two-fold. Firstly, we formalize the problem of tuning from a statistical point of view, define data-based defaults and suggest general measures quantifying the tunability of hyperparameters of algorithms. Secondly, we conduct a large-scale benchmarking study based on 38 datasets from the OpenML platform and six common machine learning algorithms. We apply our measures to assess the tunability of their parameters. Our results yield default values for hyperparameters and enable users to decide whether it is worth conducting a possibly time consuming tuning strategy, to focus on the most important hyperparameters and to choose adequate hyperparameter spaces for tuning.",

On a functional level, a partner's motivated behavior is conceptualized as an environmental cue that can contribute to an actor's motive expression and satisfaction. However, the partner's motivated behavior is considered to gain this motivational relevance only via the actor's subjective perception. Multilevel analyses of an extensive experience sampling study on partner-related communal motivation (N = up to 60,803 surveys from 508 individuals nested in 258 couples) supported the MIC model. Participants, particularly those with strong communal motive dispositions, behaved more communally at moments when they perceived their partners to behave more communally. In addition, participants experienced momentary boosts in satisfaction when they behaved more communally and, at the same time, perceived their partners' behavior as similarly communal. Broader implications of the MIC model for research on romantic relationships are discussed.",

      "abstractNote": "Can romantic partners accurately perceive each other's communal motives, or are these perceptions biased by their own motivational hopes and fears? This study used data from N = 1,905 partnered participants to examine the extent to which partner perceptions of communal motives correspond to targets' (accuracy) and perceivers' (motivational bias) explicit and implicit communal motives. Our results indicate that explicit communal motives and implicit communal approach motives can be (a) accurately inferred and (b) positively bias communal motive perception. Furthermore, there was no evidence for moderation of either accuracy or motivational bias by relationship length. These findings point to the early visibility of both implicit and explicit motives in couples, as well as their persistent biasing effects on partner perception.\n(c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

      "title": "Truth and Wishful Thinking: How Interindividual Differences in Communal Motives Manifest in Momentary Partner Perceptions",
      "abstractNote": "Although rooted in reality, partner perceptions often reflect wishful thinking due to perceivers' needs. Dispositional needs, or motives, can differ between persons; however, little is known about their differential associations with everyday partner perception. The present study used data from a 4-week experience sampling study (N = up to 60942 surveys from 510 individuals nested in 259 couples) to examine the effects of perceivers' partner-related implicit and explicit communal motives on the perception of (i) global communal partner behaviour and (ii) specific communal and uncommunal partner behaviours. The results of truth and bias models of judgement and quasi-signal detection analyses indicate that strong implicit communal approach motives and strong explicit communal motives are associated with the tendency to overestimate the partner's communal behaviour. Additionally, strong implicit communal approach motives were associated with the tendency to avoid perceptions of uncommunal partner behaviour. Neither implicit nor explicit communal motives had an effect on accuracy in the perception of particularly communal partner behaviour. The results highlight the relevance of both implicit and explicit communal motives for momentary partner perceptions and emphasise the benefits of dyadic microlongitudinal designs for a better understanding of the mechanisms through which individual differences manifest in couples' everyday lives.

      "title": "Statistical analysis of high-dimensional biomedical data: a gentle introduction to analytical goals, common approaches and challenges",
      "abstractNote": "BackgroundIn high-dimensional data (HDD) settings, the number of variables associated with each observation is very large. Prominent examples of HDD in biomedical research include omics data with a large number of variables such as many measurements across the genome, proteome, or metabolome, as well as electronic health records data that have large numbers of variables recorded for each patient. The statistical analysis of such data requires knowledge and experience, sometimes of complex methods adapted to the respective research questions.MethodsAdvances in statistical methodology and machine learning methods offer new opportunities for innovative analyses of HDD, but at the same time require a deeper understanding of some fundamental statistical concepts. Topic group TG9 \"High-dimensional data\" of the STRATOS (STRengthening Analytical Thinking for Observational Studies) initiative provides guidance for the analysis of observational studies, addressing particular statistical challenges and opportunities for the analysis of studies involving HDD. In this overview, we discuss key aspects of HDD analysis to provide a gentle introduction for non-statisticians and for classically trained statisticians with little experience specific to HDD.ResultsThe paper is organized with respect to subtopics that are most relevant for the analysis of HDD, in particular initial data analysis, exploratory data analysis, multiple testing, and prediction. For each subtopic, main analytical goals in HDD settings are outlined. For each of these goals, basic explanations for some commonly used analysis methods are provided. Situations are identified where traditional statistical methods cannot, or should not, be used in the HDD setting, or where adequate analytic tools are still lacking. Many key references are provided.ConclusionsThis review aims to provide a solid statistical foundation for researchers, including statisticians and non-statisticians, who are new to research with HDD or simply want to better evaluate and understand the results of HDD analyses.",

      "abstractNote": "In this study, we investigated the impact of the uremic toxin indoxyl sulfate on macrophages and tubular epithelial cells and its role in modulating the response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Indoxyl sulfate accumulates in the blood of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is a predictor of overall and cardiovascular morbidity/mortality. To simulate the uremic condition, primary macrophages and tubular epithelial cells were incubated with indoxyl sulfate at low concentrations as well as concentrations found in uremic patients, both alone and upon LPS challenge. The results showed that indoxyl sulfate alone induced the release of reactive oxygen species and low-grade inflammation in macrophages. Moreover, combined with LPS (proinflammatory conditions), indoxyl sulfate significantly increased TNF-a, CCL2, and IL-10 release but did not significantly affect the polarization of macrophages. Pre-treatment with indoxyl sulfate following LPS challenge induced the expression of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (Ahr) and NADPH oxidase 4 (Nox4) which generate reactive oxygen species (ROS). Further, experiments with tubular epithelial cells revealed that indoxyl sulfate might induce senescence in parenchymal cells and therefore participate in the progression of inflammaging. In conclusion, this study provides evidence that indoxyl sulfate provokes low-grade inflammation, modulates macrophage function, and enhances the inflammatory response associated with LPS. Finally, indoxyl sulfate signaling contributes to the senescence of tubular epithelial cells during injury.",

      "title": "IL1R8 Deficiency Drives Autoimmunity-Associated Lymphoma Development",
      "abstractNote": "Chronic inflammation, including that driven by autoimmunity, is associated with the development of B-cell lymphomas. IL1R8 is a regulatory receptor belonging to the IL1R family, which negatively regulates NF-kB activation following stimulation of IL1R or Toll-like receptor family members. IL1R8 deficiency is associated with the development of severe autoimmune lupus-like disease in lpr mice. We herein investigated whether concomitant exacerbated inflammation and autoimmunity caused by the deficiency of IL1R8 could recapitulate autoimmunity-associated lymphomagenesis. We thus monitored B-cell lymphoma devel-opment during the aging of IL1R8-deficient lpr mice, observing an increased lymphoid cell expansion that evolved to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Molecular and gene-expression analyses showed that the NF-kB pathway was constitutively activated in Il1r8(-/-) /lpr B splenocytes. In human DLBCL, IL1R8 had reduced expression compared with normal B cells, and higher IL1R8 expression was associated with a better outcome. Thus, IL1R8 silencing is associated with increased lymphoproliferation and transformation in the pathogenesis of B-cell lymphomas associated with autoimmunity.",

      "title": "The five types of glomerulonephritis classified by pathogenesis, activity and chronicity (GN-AC)",
      "abstractNote": "Glomerulonephritis (GN) is a diverse group of immune-mediated disorders. Currently, GN is classified largely by histological patterns that are difficult to understand and teach, and most importantly, do not indicate treatment choices. Indeed, altered systemic immunity is the primary pathogenic process and the key therapeutic target in GN. Here, we apply a conceptual framework of immune-mediated disorders to GN guided by immunopathogenesis and hence immunophenotyping: (i) infection-related GN require pathogen identification and control; (ii) autoimmunity-related GN, defined by presence of autoantibodies and (iii) alloimmunity-related GN in transplant recipients both require the suppression of adaptive immunity in lymphoid organs and bone marrow; (iv) autoinflammation-related GN, e.g. inborn errors of immunity diagnosed by genetic testing, requires suppression of single cytokine or complement pathways; and (v) Monoclonal gammopathy-related GN requires B or plasma cell clone-directed therapy. A new GN classification should include disease category, immunological activity to tailor the use of the increasing number of immunomodulatory drugs, and chronicity to trigger standard chronic kidney disease care including the evolving spectrum of cardio-renoprotective drugs. Certain biomarkers allow diagnosis and the assessment of immunological activity and disease chronicity without kidney biopsy. The use of these five GN categories and a therapy-focused GN classification is likely to overcome some of the existing hurdles in GN research, management and teaching by reflecting disease pathogenesis and guiding the therapeutic approach.",

      "abstractNote": "Background and objectives Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with CKD. We evaluated the cardioprotective effects of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor ramipril in patients on maintenance hemodialysis. Design, setting, participants, & measurements In this phase 3, prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded end point, parallel, multicenter trial, we recruitedpatientsonmaintenance hemodialysiswithhypertensionand/or left ventricular hypertrophy from 28 Italian centers. Between July 2009 and February 2014, 140 participants were randomized to ramipril (1.25-10 mg/d) and 129 participants were allocated to non-RAS inhibition therapy, both titrated up to themaximally tolerated dose to achieve predefined target BP values. The primary efficacy end point was a composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke. Secondary end points included the single components of the primary end point, new-onset or recurrence of atrial fibrillation, hospitalizations for symptomatic fluid overload, thrombosis or stenosis of the arteriovenous fistula, and changes in cardiac mass index. All outcomes were evaluated up to 42 months after randomization. Results At comparable BP control, 23 participants on ramipril (16%) and 24 on non- RAS inhibitor therapy (19%) reached the primary composite end point (hazard ratio, 0.93; 95% confidence interval, 0.52 to 1.64; P=0.80). Ramipril reduced cardiac mass index at 1 year of follow-up (between- group difference in change from baseline: 216.3g/m(2); 95% confidence interval, 229.4 to23.1), butdidnot significantlyaffect the other secondaryoutcomes. Hypotensive episodes were more frequent in participants allocated to ramipril than controls (41% versus 12%). Twenty participants on ramipril and nine controls developed cancer, including six gastrointestinalmalignancies on ramipril (four were fatal), compared with none in controls. Conclusions Ramipril did not reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events in patients on maintenance hemodialysis.",

Therefore, we hypothesized that CatS/PAR-2 inhibition/deficiency would attenuate chronic allograft vasculopathy.Methods: Heterotopic aortic murine transplantation was performed from C57BL/6J donors to C57BL/6J re-cipients (syngeneic control group), Balb/c to C57BL/6J without treatment (allogenic control group), Balb/c to C57BL/6J with twice daily oral CatS inhibitor (allogenic treatment group) and Balb/c to Par2-/-C57BL/6J (allogenic knockout group). The recipients were sacrificed on day 28 and the grafts were harvested for histo-logical analysis and RT-qPCR.Results: After 28 days, mice of the allogenic control group exhibited significant neointima formation and massive CD8 T-cell infiltration into the neointima while the syngeneic control group showed negligible allograft vas-culopathy. The mRNA expression level of CatS in allografts was 5-fold of those in syngeneic grafts. Neointima formation and therefore intima/media-ratio were significantly decreased in the treatment and knockout group in comparison to the allogenic control group. Mice in treatment group also displayed significantly fewer CD8 T cells in the neointima compared with allogeneic controls. Additionally, treatment with the CatS inhibitor and PAR2-deficiency decreased mRNA-levels of interleukins and cytokines.Conclusion: In conclusion, our data indicate that inhibiting CatS and PAR-2 deficiency led to a marked reduction of neointima formation and associated inflammation in a murine heterotopic model for allograft vasculopathy.",

      "abstractNote": "Background Mononuclear phagocytes (MPs), including macrophages, monocytes, and dendritic cells (DCs), are phagocytic cells with important roles in immunity. The developmental origin of kidney DCs has been highly debated because of the large phenotypic overlap between macrophages and DCs in this tissue.\nMethods We used fate mapping, RNA sequencing, flow cytometry, confocal microscopy, and histocytometry to assess the origin and phenotypic and functional properties of renal DCs in healthy kidney and of DCs after cisplatin and ischemia reperfusion-induced kidney injury.\nResults Adult kidney contains at least four subsets of MPs with prominent Clec9a-expression history indicating a DC origin. We demonstrate that these populations are phenotypically, functionally, and transcriptionally distinct from each other. We also show these kidney MPs exhibit unique age-dependent developmental heterogeneity. Kidneys from newborn mice contain a prominent population of embryonic-derived MHCII(neg)F4/80(hi) CD11b(low )macrophages that express T cell Ig and mucin domain containing 4 (TIM-4) and MER receptor tyrosine kinase (MERTK). These macrophages are replaced within a few weeks after birth by phenotypically similar cells that express MHCII but lack TIM-4 and MERTK. MHCII(+)F4/80(hi )cells exhibit prominent Clec9a-expression history in adulthood but not early life, indicating additional age-dependent developmental heterogeneity. In AKI, MHCII(neg)F4/80(hi )cells reappear in adult kidneys as a result of MHCII downregulation by resident MHCII(+)F4/80(hi) cells, possibly in response to prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). RNA sequencing further suggests MHCII(+)F4/80(hi) cells help coordinate the recruitment of inflammatory cells during renal injury.\nConclusions Distinct developmental programs contribute to renal DC and macrophage populations throughout life, which could have important implications for therapies targeting these cells.",

      "title": "Selective depletion of a CD64-expressing phagocyte subset mediates protection against toxic kidney injury and failure",
      "abstractNote": "Dendritic cells (DC), macrophages, and monocytes, collectively known as mononuclear phagocytes (MPs), critically control tissue homeostasis and immune defense. However, there is a paucity of models allowing to selectively manipulate subsets of these cells in specific tissues. The steady-state adult kidney contains four MP subsets with Clec9a-expression history that include the main conventional DC1 (cDC1) and cDC2 subtypes as well as two subsets marked by CD64 but varying levels of F4/80. How each of these MP subsets contributes to the different phases of acute kidney injury and repair is unknown. We created a mouse model with a Cre-inducible lox-STOP-lox-diph-theria toxin receptor cassette under control of the endogenous CD64 locus that allows for diphtheria toxin-mediated depletion of CD64-expressing MPs without affecting cDC1, cDC2, or other leukocytes in the kidney. Combined with specific depletion of cDC1 and cDC2, we revisited the role of MPs in cisplatin-induced kidney injury. We found that the intrinsic potency reported for CD11c(+) cells to limit cisplatin toxicity is specifically attributed to CD64(+) MPs, while cDC1 and cDC2 were dispensable. Thus, we report a mouse model allowing for selective depletion of a specific subset of renal MPs. Our findings in cisplatin-induced injury underscore the value of dissecting the functions of individual MP subsets in kidney disease, which may enable therapeutic targeting of specific immune components in the absence of general immunosuppression.",

      "title": "Single-center versus multi-center data sets for molecular prognostic modeling: a simulation study",
      "abstractNote": "Background Prognostic models based on high-dimensional omics data generated from clinical patient samples, such as tumor tissues or biopsies, are increasingly used for prognosis of radio-therapeutic success. The model development process requires two independent discovery and validation data sets. Each of them may contain samples collected in a single center or a collection of samples from multiple centers. Multi-center data tend to be more heterogeneous than single-center data but are less affected by potential site-specific biases. Optimal use of limited data resources for discovery and validation with respect to the expected success of a study requires dispassionate, objective decision-making. In this work, we addressed the impact of the choice of single-center and multi-center data as discovery and validation data sets, and assessed how this impact depends on the three data characteristics signal strength, number of informative features and sample size. Methods We set up a simulation study to quantify the predictive performance of a model trained and validated on different combinations of in silico single-center and multi-center data. The standard bioinformatical analysis workflow of batch correction, feature selection and parameter estimation was emulated. For the determination of model quality, four measures were used: false discovery rate, prediction error, chance of successful validation (significant correlation of predicted and true validation data outcome) and model calibration. Results In agreement with literature about generalizability of signatures, prognostic models fitted to multi-center data consistently outperformed their single-center counterparts when the prediction error was the quality criterion of interest. However, for low signal strengths and small sample sizes, single-center discovery sets showed superior performance with respect to false discovery rate and chance of successful validation. Conclusions With regard to decision making, this simulation study underlines the importance of study aims being defined precisely a priori. Minimization of the prediction error requires multi-center discovery data, whereas single-center data are preferable with respect to false discovery rate and chance of successful validation when the expected signal or sample size is low. In contrast, the choice of validation data solely affects the quality of the estimator of the prediction error, which was more precise on multi-center validation data.",

      "abstractNote": "Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) originated in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 has been declared pandemic by World Health Organization due to an exponential rise in the number of infected and deceased persons across the globe. Emerging reports suggest that susceptibility and mortality rates are higher in patients with certain comorbidities when compared to the average population. Cardiovascular diseases and diabetes are important risk factors for a lethal outcome of COVID-19. Extensive research ensuing the outbreak of coronavirus-related severe acute respiratory syndrome in the year 2003, and COVID-19 recently revealed a role of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) components in the entry of coronavirus wherein angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) had garnered the significant attention. This raises the question whether the use of RAS inhibitors, the backbone of treatment of cardiovascular, neurovascular, and kidney diseases could increase the susceptibility for coronavirus infection or unfortunate outcomes of COVID-19. Thus, currently, there is a lack of consensus regarding the effects of RAS inhibitors in such patients. Moreover, expert bodies like American Heart Association, American College of Cardiology, and so on have now released official statements that RAS inhibitors must be continued, unless suggested otherwise by a physician. In this brief review, we will elaborate on the role of RAS and ACE2 in pathogenesis of COVID-19. Moreover, we will discuss the potential effect of the use and disuse of RAS inhibitors in patients having COVID-19 with cardiometabolic comorbidities.",

      "abstractNote": "Multi-factorial survey experiments have become a well-established tool in social sciences as they combine experimental designs with advantages of heterogeneous respondent samples. This paper investigates three under-researched design features: how to present vignettes (running text vs. table), how to measure responses (rating vs. open scale), and how to sort vignettes (random vs. extreme-cases-first, to prevent censored responses). Experiments were conducted in a 2 x 2 x 2 between-subject design with 408 university students rating decks a 20 vignettes. Analyses of 7,895 ratings showed no differences of whether vignettes were presented as running texts or tables. Open scales revealed more measurement problems, e.g., missing values, than rating scales. Finally, vignettes presented randomly sorted produced similar results compared to sorting extreme vignette cases first. Recommendations based on the findings are to use random orders of vignettes and rating scales. Table vignettes provide an alternative to text vignettes but should be further evaluated with heterogeneous samples.",

      "abstractNote": "To what extent has the closing of the gender gap in hourly wages ('gender wage gap'; GWG) in Western Germany stalled due to an increasing supply of non-standard working hours? We use descriptive trend analyses and Juhn-Murphy-Pierce decompositions of German Socio-Economic Panel data for the last 30 years (1985-2014) to analyse the extent to which the expansion of part-time and marginal work, as well as overwork, may have contributed to the dynamics of the GWG in Western Germany. We find that the large increase in part-time work among women in combination with increasing wage gaps between part-time and full-time work substantially widened the GWG (by about one-sixth). Working hour effects were large enough to offset the equalizing effects of declining gender gaps in human capital, and they existed even in the public sector. In contrast to the United States, trends in overwork did not have a meaningful impact on the GWG. In an add-on, we find a widening of the gender gap in monthly earnings, but also an important closing of the gender earnings gap unconditional on employment due to an increased labour supply of women. Our results suggest that working hours should be given more consideration in research on family-work conflict and gender earnings inequalities.",

      "abstractNote": "We present two openly accessible databases related to the assessment of implicit motives using Picture Story Exercises (PSEs): (a) A database of 183,415 German sentences, nested in 26,389 stories provided by 4,570 participants, which have been coded by experts using Winter's coding system for the implicit affiliation/intimacy, achievement, and power motives, and (b) a database of 54 classic and new pictures which have been used as PSE stimuli. Updated picture norms are provided which can be used to select appropriate pictures for PSE applications. Based on an analysis of the relations between raw motive scores, word count, and sentence count, we give recommendations on how to control motive scores for story length, and validate the recommendation with a meta-analysis on gender differences in the implicit affiliation motive that replicates existing findings. We discuss to what extent the guiding principles of the story length correction can be generalized to other content coding systems for narrative material. Several potential applications of the databases are discussed, including (un)supervised machine learning of text content, psychometrics, and better reproducibility of PSE research.",

      "abstractNote": "The investigation of within-person process models, often done in experience sampling designs, requires a reliable assessment of within-person change. In this paper, we focus on dyadic intensive longitudinal designs where both partners of a couple are assessed multiple times each day across several days. We introduce a statistical model for variance decomposition based on generalizability theory (extending P. E. Shrout & S. P. Lane, 2012), which can estimate the relative proportion of variability on four hierarchical levels: moments within a day, days, persons, and couples. Based on these variance estimates, four reliability coefficients are derived: between-couples, between-persons, within-persons/between-days, and within-persons/between-moments. We apply the model to two dyadic intensive experience sampling studies (n(1) = 130 persons, 5 surveys each day for 14 days, >= 7508 unique surveys; n(2) = 508 persons, 5 surveys each day for 28 days, >= 47764 unique surveys). Five different scales in the domain of motivational processes and relationship quality were assessed with 2 to 5 items: State relationship satisfaction, communal motivation, and agentic motivation; the latter consists of two subscales, namely power and independence motivation. Largest variance components were on the level of persons, moments, couples, and days, where within-day variance was generally larger than between-day variance. Reliabilities ranged from .32 to .76 (couple level), .93 to .98 (person level), .61 to .88 (day level), and .28 to .72 (moment level). Scale intercorrelations reveal differential structures between and within persons, which has consequences for theory building and statistical modeling.",

      "abstractNote": "Background The roles of asymptomatic hyperuricemia or uric acid (UA) crystals in CKD progression are unknown. Hypotheses to explain links between UA deposition and progression of CKD include that (1) asymptomatic hyperuricemia does not promote CKD progression unless UA crystallizes in the kidney; (2) UA crystal granulomas may form due to pre-existing CKD; and (3) proinflammatory granuloma-related M1-like macrophages may drive UA crystal-induced CKD progression.\nMethods MALDI-FTICR mass spectrometry, immunohistochemistry, 3D confocal microscopy, and flow cytometry were used to characterize a novel mouse model of hyperuricemia and chronic UA crystal nephropathy with granulomatous nephritis. Interventional studies probed the role of crystal-induced inflammation and macrophages in the pathology of progressive CKD.\nResults Asymptomatic hyperuricemia alone did not cause CKDor drive the progression of aristolochic acid I-induced CKD. Only hyperuricemia with UA crystalluria due to urinary acidification caused tubular obstruction, inflammation, and interstitial fibrosis. UA crystal granulomas surrounded by proinflammatory M1-likemacrophages developed late in this process of chronic UA crystal nephropathy and contributed to the progression of pre-existing CKD. SuppressingM1-like macrophages with adenosine attenuated granulomatous nephritis and the progressive decline inGFR. In contrast, inhibiting the JAK/STAT inflammatory pathway with tofacitinib was not renoprotective.\nConclusions Asymptomatic hyperuricemia does not affect CKD progression unless UA crystallizes in the kidney. UA crystal granulomas develop late in chronic UA crystal nephropathy and contribute to CKD progression because UA crystals trigger M1-like macrophage-related interstitial inflammation and fibrosis. Targeting proinflammatory macrophages, but not JAK/STATsignaling, can attenuategranulomatous interstitial nephritis.",

      "abstractNote": "Worldwide, around 850 million people are diagnosed with kidney disease but the available treatment options are still limited. Preclinical studies propose a plethora of druggable targets that can attenuate kidney disease and could qualify as novel therapeutic strategies, although most of these targets still await clinical testing. Here, we review some promising candidate targets for chronic kidney disease: intermedin, periostin, sirtuin, the cannabinoid receptor, Klotho, and uromodulin. For acute kidney injury, we discuss Apelin, Elabela, growth differentiation factor-15, Fyn kinase, and Klotho. Target selection for further clinical development should consider redundancies with the standard of care, potential synergistic effects with existing treatments, as well as the potential of additional effects on the cardiovascular system as a common comorbidity in patients with kidney disease.",

      "abstractNote": "Liver and kidney are vital organs that maintain homeostasis and injury to either of them triggers pathogenic pathways affecting the other. For example, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) promotes the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD), vice versa acute kidney injury (AKI) endorses the induction and progression of liver dysfunction. Progress in clinical and basic research suggest a role of excessive fructose intake, insulin resistance, inflammatory cytokines production, activation of the renin-angiotensin system, redox imbalance, and their impact on epigenetic regulation of gene expression in this context. Recent developments in experimental and clinical research have identified several biochemical and molecular pathways for AKI-liver interaction, including altered liver enzymes profile, metabolic acidosis, oxidative stress, activation of inflammatory and regulated cell death pathways. This review focuses on the current preclinical and clinical findings on kidney-liver crosstalk in NAFLD-CKD and AKI-liver dysfunction settings and highlights potential molecular mechanisms and therapeutic targets.",

      "abstractNote": "Besides assisting the maintenance of blood pressure and sodium homeostasis, the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a pivotal role in pathogenesis of acute kidney injury (AKI). The RAS is equipped with two arms i) the pressor arm composed of Angiotensin II (Ang II)/Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)/Angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) also called conventional RAS, and ii) the depressor arm consisting of Angiotensin (1-7) (Ang 1-7)/Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)/MasR known as non-conventional RAS. Activation of conventional RAS triggers oxidative stress, inflammatory, hypertrophic, apoptotic, and pro-fibrotic signaling cascades which promote AKI. The preclinical and clinical studies have reported beneficial as well as deleterious effects of RAS blockage either by angiotensin receptor blocker or ACE inhibitor in AKI. On the contrary, the depressor arm opposes the conventional RAS, has beneficial effects on the kidney but has been less explored in pathogenesis of AKI. This review focuses on significance of RAS in pathogenesis of AKI and provides better understanding of novel and possible therapeutic approaches to combat AKI.",

      "title": "Epigenetic regulation of Toll-like receptors 2 and 4 in kidney disease",
      "abstractNote": "Kidney disease affects more than 10% of the worldwide population and causes significant morbidity and mortality. Epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) play a pivotal role in the progression of kidney disease. These epigenetic mechanisms are reversible and majorly involved in regulating gene expression of inflammatory, fibrotic, and apoptotic proteins. Emerging data suggest that the Toll-like receptor 2 and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR2 and TLR4) are expressed by almost all types of kidney cells and known for promoting inflammation by recognizing damage-associated molecular proteins (DAMPs). Epigenetic mechanisms regulate TLR2 and TLR4 signaling in various forms of kidney disease where different histone modifications promote the transcription of the TLR2 and TLR4 gene and its ligand high mobility group box protein 1 (HMGB1). Moreover, numerous long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) modulate TLR2 and TLR4 signaling in kidney disease. However, the precise mechanisms behind this regulation are still enigmatic. Studying the epigenetic mechanisms involved in the regulation of TLR2 and TLR4 signaling in the development of kidney disease may help in understanding and finding novel therapeutic strategies. This review discusses the intricate relationship of epigenetic mechanisms with TLR2 and TLR4 in different forms of kidney diseases. In addition, we discuss the different lncRNAs and miRNAs that regulate TLR2 and TLR4 as potential therapeutic targets in kidney disease.",

      "abstractNote": "Diabetes is one of the major cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD), including \"diabetic nephropathy,\" and is an increasingly prevalent accelerator of the progression of non-diabetic forms of CKD. The long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have come into the limelight in the past few years as one of the emerging weapons against CKD in diabetes. Available data over the past few years demonstrate the interaction of lncRNAs with miRNAs and epigenetic machinery. Interestingly, the evolving data suggest that lncRNAs play a vital role in diabetes-associated CKD by regulation of epigenetic enzymes such as DNA methyltransferase, histone deacetylases, and histone methyltransferases. LncRNAs are also engaged in the regulation of several miRNAs in diabetic nephropathy. Hence this review will elaborate on the association between lncRNAs and their interaction with epigenetic regulators involved in different aspects and thus the progression of CKD in diabetes.",

      "abstractNote": "Kidney disease is the 6th fastest-growing cause of death and a serious global health concern that urges effective therapeutic options. The inflammatory response is an initial reaction from immune and parenchymal cells in kidney diseases. Toll-like receptors (TLR) 2 and 4 are highly expressed by various kidney cells and respond to 'signaling danger' proteins, such as high mobility group box binding protein 1 (HMGB1) and prompt the progression of kidney disease by releasing inflammatory mediators. Burgeoning reports suggest that both SGLT2 and ER stress elevates TLR2/4 signaling via different axis. Moreover, SGLT2 signaling aggravates inflammation under the disease condition by promoting the NLR family pyrin domain-containing three inflammasomes and ER stress. Intriguingly, TLR2/4 downstream adaptors activate ER stress regulators. The above-discussed interactions imply that TLR2/4 does more than immune response during kidney disease. Here, we discuss in detail evidence of the roles and regulation of TLR2/4 in the context of a relationship between ER stress and SGLT2. Also, we highlighted different preclinical studies of SGLT2 inhibitors against TLR2/4 signaling in various kidney diseases. Moreover, we discuss the observational and interventional evidence about the relation between TLR2/4, ER stress, and SGLT2, which may represent the TLR2/4 as a potential therapeutic target for kidney disease.",

      "abstractNote": "Rationale:\nCholesterol crystal embolism can be a life-threatening complication of advanced atherosclerosis. Pathophysiology and molecular targets for treatment are largely unknown.\nObjective:\nWe aimed to develop a new animal model of cholesterol crystal embolism to dissect the molecular mechanisms of cholesterol crystal (CC)-driven arterial occlusion, tissue infarction, and organ failure.\nMethods and Results:\nC57BL/6J mice were injected with CC into the left kidney artery. Primary end point was glomerular filtration rate (GFR). CC caused crystal clots occluding intrarenal arteries and a dose-dependent drop in GFR, followed by GFR recovery within 4 weeks, that is, acute kidney disease. In contrast, the extent of kidney infarction was more variable. Blocking necroptosis using mixed lineage kinase domain-like deficient mice or necrostatin-1s treatment protected from kidney infarction but not from GFR loss because arterial obstructions persisted, identifying crystal clots as a primary target to prevent organ failure. CC involved platelets, neutrophils, fibrin, and extracellular DNA. Neutrophil depletion or inhibition of the release of neutrophil extracellular traps had little effects, but platelet P2Y12 receptor antagonism with clopidogrel, fibrinolysis with urokinase, or DNA digestion with recombinant DNase I all prevented arterial occlusions, GFR loss, and kidney infarction. The window-of-opportunity was <3 hours after CC injection. However, combining Nec-1s (necrostatin-1s) prophylaxis given 1 hour before and DNase I 3 hours after CC injection completely prevented kidney failure and infarcts. In vitro, CC did not directly induce plasmatic coagulation but induced neutrophil extracellular trap formation and DNA release mainly from kidney endothelial cells, neutrophils, and few from platelets. CC induced ATP release from aggregating platelets, which increased fibrin formation in a DNase-dependent manner.\nConclusions:\nCC embolism causes arterial obstructions and organ failure via the formation of crystal clots with fibrin, platelets, and extracellular DNA as critical components. Therefore, our model enables to unravel the pathogenesis of the CC embolism syndrome as a basis for both prophylaxis and targeted therapy.",

      "abstractNote": "Clotting and inflammation are effective danger response patterns positively selected by evolution to limit fatal bleeding and pathogen invasion upon traumatic injuries. As a trade-off, thrombotic, and thromboembolic events complicate severe forms of infectious and non-infectious states of acute and chronic inflammation, i.e., immunothrombosis. Factors linked to thrombosis and inflammation include mediators released by platelet granules, complement, and lipid mediators and certain integrins. Extracellular deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was a previously unrecognized cellular component in the blood, which elicits profound proinflammatory and prothrombotic effects. Pathogens trigger the release of extracellular DNA together with other pathogen-associated molecular patterns. Dying cells in the inflamed or infected tissue release extracellular DNA together with other danger associated molecular pattern (DAMPs). Neutrophils release DNA by forming neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) during infection, trauma or other forms of vascular injury. Fluorescence tissue imaging localized extracellular DNA to sites of injury and to intravascular thrombi. Functional studies using deoxyribonuclease (DNase)-deficient mouse strains or recombinant DNase show that extracellular DNA contributes to the process of immunothrombosis. Here, we review rodent models of immunothrombosis and the evolving evidence for extracellular DNA as a driver of immunothrombosis and discuss challenges and prospects for extracellular DNA as a potential therapeutic target.",

      "title": "Neutrophil circadian rhythm is associated with different outcomes of acute kidney injury due to cholesterol crystal embolism",
      "abstractNote": "Cholesterol crystal (CC) embolism can cause acute tissue infarction and ischemic necrosis via triggering diffuse thrombotic angiopathy occluding arterioles and arteries. Neutrophils contribute to crystal-induced immunothrombosis as well as to ischemic necrosis-related necroinflammation. We speculated that CC embolism-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) would be circadian rhythm-dependent and associated with cyclic differences in neutrophil function. Injection of CC into the left kidney induced thrombotic angiopathy progressing starting as early as 3 h after CC injection followed by a progressive ischemic cortical necrosis and AKI at 24 h. In C57BL/6J mice, circulating CD11b(+)Ly6G(+) neutrophils were higher during the day phase [Zeitgeber time (ZT) 0-12] compared to the dark phase (ZT12-24). In the time frame of thrombus formation at ZT13, more neutrophils were recruited into the injured kidney 24 h later compared to CC embolism at ZT5. This effect was associated with an increased circulating number of CXCR2(+) neutrophils as well as an upregulated kidney adhesion molecule and chemokine expression. These findings were associated with a significant increase in kidney necrosis, and endothelial injury at ZT13. Thus, the time of day has an effect also on CC embolism-related AKI in association with the circadian rhythm of neutrophil recruitment.",

      "abstractNote": "Cholesterol crystal (CC) embolism is a complication of advanced atherosclerotic plaques located in the major arteries. This pathological condition is primarily induced by interventional and surgical procedures or occurs spontaneously. CC can induce a wide range of tissue injuries including CC embolism syndrome, a spontaneous or intervention-induced complication of advanced atherosclerosis, while treatment of CC embolism has remained empiric. Vascular occlusions caused by CC embolism may exceed the ischemia tolerance of many tissues, particularly when small arteries are affected. The main approach to CC embolism is primary prophylaxis in patients at risk by stabilizing atherosclerotic plaques and avoiding unnecessary catheter interventions. During CC embolism, the use of platelet inhibitors to avoid abnormal activation and aggregation and anticoagulants may reduce the risk of vascular occlusions and tissue ischemia. This probably explains the relatively low prevalence of clinical manifestations of CC embolism, which are frequently found in autopsy studies. In this review, we summarized the current knowledge on the pathophysiology of CC embolism syndrome deriving from clinical observations and experimental mouse models. Furthermore, we described the risk factors of CC embolism in humans as well as the experimental studies based on empiric treatments. We also discuss potential therapeutic interventions based on recent experimental data and emerging drug options evolving from other research domains. Given the substantial unmet medical need to improve the outcomes of CC embolism, the identification of effective treatment strategies is urgently needed.\nCholesterol crystal (CC) embolism is a complication of advanced atherosclerotic plaques. It is primarily induced by anticoagulants and thrombolytic interventions and vascular surgical procedures. The main approach to CC embolism is primary prophylaxis in patients at risk by stabilizing atherosclerotic plaques (statin therapy) and avoiding unnecessary catheter interventions. Platelet aggregation inhibitors and anticoagulants may reduce the risk of vascular occlusions in case CC embolism occurs. Furthermore, life style controlling is another useful way to prevent atherosclerosis and CC embolism.image",

      "abstractNote": "The perpetuation of inflammation is an important pathophysiological contributor to the global medical burden. Chronic inflammation is promoted by non-programmed cell death(1,)(2); however, how inflammation is instigated, its cellular and molecular mediators, and its therapeutic value are poorly defined. Here we use mouse models of atherosclerosis-a major underlying cause of mortality worldwide-to demonstrate that extracellular histone H4-mediated membrane lysis of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) triggers arterial tissue damage and inflammation. We show that activated lesional SMCs attract neutrophils, triggering the ejection of neutrophil extracellular traps that contain nuclear proteins. Among them, histone H4 binds to and lyses SMCs, leading to the destabilization of plaques; conversely, the neutralization of histone H4 prevents cell death of SMCs and stabilizes atherosclerotic lesions. Our data identify a form of cell death found at the core of chronic vascular disease that is instigated by leukocytes and can be targeted therapeutically.",

      "abstractNote": "In many research fields, the widespread use of questionable research practices has jeopardized the credibility of scientific results. One of the most prominent questionable research practices is p-hacking. Typically, p-hacking is defined as a compound of strategies targeted at rendering non-significant hypothesis testing results significant. However, a comprehensive overview of these p-hacking strategies is missing, and current meta-scientific research often ignores the heterogeneity of strategies. Here, we compile a list of 12 p-hacking strategies based on an extensive literature review, identify factors that control their level of severity, and demonstrate their impact on false-positive rates using simulation studies. We also use our simulation results to evaluate several approaches that have been proposed to mitigate the influence of questionable research practices. Our results show that investigating p-hacking at the level of strategies can provide a better understanding of the process of p-hacking, as well as a broader basis for developing effective countermeasures. By making our analyses available through a Shiny app and R package, we facilitate future meta-scientific research aimed at investigating the ramifications of p-hacking across multiple strategies, and we hope to start a broader discussion about different manifestations of p-hacking in practice.",

      "abstractNote": "In a sequential hypothesis test, the analyst checks at multiple steps during data collection whether sufficient evidence has accrued to make a decision about the tested hypotheses. As soon as sufficient information has been obtained, data collection is terminated. Here, we compare two sequential hypothesis testing procedures that have recently been proposed for use in psychological research: Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT; Psychological Methods, 25(2), 206-226, 2020) and the Sequential Bayes Factor Test (SBFT; Psychological Methods, 22(2), 322-339, 2017). We show that although the two methods have different philosophical roots, they share many similarities and can even be mathematically regarded as two instances of an overarching hypothesis testing framework. We demonstrate that the two methods use the same mechanisms for evidence monitoring and error control, and that differences in efficiency between the methods depend on the exact specification of the statistical models involved, as well as on the population truth. Our simulations indicate that when deciding on a sequential design within a unified sequential testing framework, researchers need to balance the needs of test efficiency, robustness against model misspecification, and appropriate uncertainty quantification. We provide guidance for navigating these design decisions based on individual preferences and simulation-based design analyses.",

      "abstractNote": "Well-designed experiments are likely to yield compelling evidence with efficient sample sizes. Bayes Factor Design Analysis (BFDA) is a recently developed methodology that allows researchers to balance the informativeness and efficiency of their experiment (Schonbrodt & Wagenmakers, Psychonomic Bulletin & Review, 25(1), 128-142 2018). With BFDA, researchers can control the rate of misleading evidence but, in addition, they can plan for a target strength of evidence. BFDA can be applied to fixed-N and sequential designs. In this tutorial paper, we provide an introduction to BFDA and analyze how the use of informed prior distributions affects the results of the BFDA. We also present a user-friendly web-based BFDA application that allows researchers to conduct BFDAs with ease. Two practical examples highlight how researchers can use a BFDA to plan for informative and efficient research designs.",

      "abstractNote": "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multisystemic autoimmune disease that frequently affects the kidneys, known as lupus nephritis (LN). Such patients are treated with antimalarials, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs, and more recently, target-specific biological drugs. Although efficacy of these therapies improved SLE-related outcomes, SLE remains associated with higher rates of infections. Here, we performed a comprehensive systemic review of infectious complications in clinical trials covering drug interventions for SLE or specifically for active LN. Our search in 15 online registries yielded a total of 1477 studies of which 14 matched our prespecified criteria. These covered the biological drugs anifrolumab, belimumab, and rituximab that were tested in patients with non-renal SLE and active LN. The available safety data from the SLE trials indicated that infectious complications such as herpes zoster, upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis, bronchitis, and urinary tract infection in patients receiving placebo were quite prevalent especially in the EXPLORER (rituximab) trial. Infections occurred mostly during the first year of LN therapy. Serious adverse events and infectious complications occurred more frequently in placebo-treated patients with active LN, especially in the BLISS-LN (belimumab) and LUNAR (rituximab) trials. Anifrolumab and rituximab increased the number of clinically relevant episodes of herpes zoster compared to belimumab in patients with active LN. Anifrolumab displayed a similar trend for influenza infections, which is consistent with the specific mechanisms-of-action of anifrolumab; highlighting drug-specific effects on infectious complications. In addition, standard-of-care therapy, e.g., MMF and immunosuppressants, as well as a longer SLE duration may also affect the incidence of serious adverse events and certain infectious complications in SLE patients with active LN. Infectious complications are common in SLE but even more common in patients with active LN, especially herpes zoster is strongly associated with active LN and anifrolumab therapy (OR 2.8, 95% CI 1.18 to 6.66, p = 0.018). Immunotherapy seems to impose unspecific and specific risks for infections. The latter may imply specific precautions such as preemptive vaccination and individual risk-benefit assessments.",

Although a phase 2 clinical trial of anifrolumab did not meet its primary end point, further studies are needed to assess the effects of interferon blockade on flare rates of lupus nephritis. However, the observed higher risk of herpes zoster associated with anifrolumab use suggests that caution is warranted with this strategy.",

      "title": "Secondary Immunodeficiency Related to Kidney Disease (SIDKD)-Definition, Unmet Need, and Mechanisms",
      "abstractNote": "Kidney disease is a known risk factor for poor outcomes of COVID-19 and many other serious infections. Conversely, infection is the second most common cause of death in patients with kidney disease. However, little is known about the underlying secondary immunodeficiency related to kidney disease (SIDKD). In contrast to cardiovascular disease related to kidney disease, which has triggered countless epidemiologic, clinical, and experimental research activities or interventional trials, investments in tracing, understanding, and therapeutically targeting SIDKD have been sparse. As a call for more awareness of SIDKD as an imminent unmet medical need that requires rigorous research activities at all levels, we review the epidemiology of SIDKD and the numerous aspects of the abnormal immunophenotype of patients with kidney disease. We propose a definition of SIDKD and discuss the pathogenic mechanisms of SIDKD known thus far, including more recent insights into the unexpected immunoregulatory roles of elevated levels of FGF23 and hyperuricemia and shifts in the secretome of the intestinal microbiota in kidney disease. As an ultimate goal, we should aim to develop therapeutics that can reduce mortality due to infections in patients with kidney disease by normalizing host defense to pathogens and immune responses to vaccines.",

      "abstractNote": "Patients with immune-mediated kidney diseases are at increased risk of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The international rollout of COVID-19 vaccines has provided varying degrees of protection and enabled the understanding of vaccine efficacy and safety. The immune response to COVID-19 vaccines is lower in most patients with immune-mediated kidney diseases; either related to immunosuppression or comorbidities and complications caused by the underlying disease. Humoral vaccine response, measured by the presence of antibodies, is impaired or absent in patients receiving rituximab, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), higher doses of glucocorticoids and likely other immunosuppressants, such as cyclophosphamide. The timing between the use of these agents and administration of vaccines is associated with the level of immune response: with rituximab, vaccine response can only be expected once B cells start to recover and patients with transient discontinuation of MMF mount a humoral response more frequently. The emergence of new COVID-19 variants and waning of vaccine-induced immunity highlight the value of a booster dose and the need to develop mutant-proof vaccines. COVID-19 vaccines are safe, exhibiting a very low risk of de novo or relapsing immune-mediated kidney disease. Population-based studies will determine whether this is causal or coincidental. Such cases respond to standard management, including the use of immunosuppression. The Immunonephrology Working Group and European Vasculitis Society recommend that patients with immune-mediated kidney diseases follow national guidance on vaccination. Booster doses based on antibody measurements could be considered.",

      "abstractNote": "The power motive predicts influential social behaviour; however, its heterogeneous conceptualisations have produced inconsistent results. To overcome this problem, we developed and validated a unitary taxonomy of social power motives based on established delineations of social hierarchies: the dominance, prestige, and leadership account. While we could measure these motives both reliably and distinctively (study 1), we also showed they strongly related to a common power desire (study 2). Assessing their nomological networks (studies 3 and 4), we demonstrated distinct associations between the dominance motive (D: wanting to coerce others into adhering to one's will) and anger and verbal aggression; the prestige motive (P: wanting to obtain admiration and respect) and the fear of losing reputation and claiming to have higher moral concerns; the leadership motive (L: wanting to take responsibility in and for one's group) and emotional stability and helping behaviour. Furthermore, while D uniquely predicted agonistic/retaliatory behaviour in dictator games (study 5), L uniquely predicted the attainment of higher employment ranks in various professions (study 7). Finally, at least to some degree, P and L related positively, and D negatively to prosocial donating behaviour (study 6). This taxonomy represents a novel and powerful approach to predicting influential social behaviour. (c) 2018 European Association of Personality Psychology",

      "abstractNote": "Can the male citation advantage (more citations for papers written by male than female scientists) be explained by gender homophily bias, i.e., the preference of scientists to cite other scientists of the same gender category? Previous studies report much evidence that this is the case. However, the observed gender homophily bias may be overestimated by overlooking structural aspects such as the gender composition of research topics in which scientists specialize. When controlling for research topics at a high level of granularity, there is only little evidence for a gender homophily bias in citation decisions. Our study points out the importance of controlling structural aspects such as gendered specialization in research topics when investigating gender bias in science.",

      "abstractNote": "The COVID-19 pandemic is progressing worldwide with an alarming death toll. There is an urgent need for novel therapeutic strategies to combat potentially fatal complications. Distinctive clinical features of severe COVID-19 include acute respiratory distress syndrome, neutrophilia, and cytokine storm, along with severe inflammatory response syndrome or sepsis. Here, we propose the putative role of enhanced neutrophil infiltration and the release of neutrophil extracellular traps, complement activation and vascular thrombosis during necroinflammation in COVID-19. Furthermore, we discuss how neutrophilic inflammation contributes to the higher mortality of COVID-19 in patients with underlying co-morbidities such as diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. This perspective highlights neutrophils as a putative target for the immunopathologic complications of severely ill COVID-19 patients. Development of the novel therapeutic strategies targeting neutrophils may help reduce the overall disease fatality rate of COVID-19.",

      "abstractNote": "Acute kidney injury (AKI) is morphologically characterized by a synchronized plasma membrane rupture of cells in a specific section of a nephron, referred to as acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Whereas the involvement of necroptosis is well characterized, genetic evidence supporting the contribution of ferroptosis is lacking. Here, we demonstrate that the loss of ferroptosis suppressor protein 1 (Fsp1) or the targeted manipulation of the active center of the selenoprotein glutathione peroxidase 4 (Gpx4(cys/-)) sensitize kidneys to tubular ferroptosis, resulting in a unique morphological pattern of tubular necrosis. Given the unmet medical need to clinically inhibit AKI, we generated a combined small molecule inhibitor (Nec-1f) that simultaneously targets receptor interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) and ferroptosis in cell lines, in freshly isolated primary kidney tubules and in mouse models of cardiac transplantation and of AKI and improved survival in models of ischemia-reperfusion injury. Based on genetic and pharmacological evidence, we conclude that GPX4 dysfunction hypersensitizes mice to ATN during AKI. Additionally, we introduce Nec-1f, a solid inhibitor of RIPK1 and weak inhibitor of ferroptosis. Necroptosis, a form of cell death, occurs in acute renal injury. Here, the authors show that ferroptosis-a form of cell death dependent on iron - also occurs during acute kidney injury, and show that an inhibitor of ferroptosis can improve survival in a mouse model of acute kidney damage.",

      "abstractNote": "Signaling pathways of regulated necrosis, such as necroptosis and ferroptosis, contribute to acute kidney injury (AKI), but the role of pyroptosis is unclear. Pyroptosis is mediated by the pore-forming protein gasdermin D (GSDMD). Here, we report a specific pattern of GSDMD-protein expression in the peritubular compartment of mice that underwent bilateral ischemia and reperfusion injury (IRI). Along similar lines, the GSDMD-protein expression in whole kidney lysates increased during the first 84 h following cisplatin-induced AKI. Importantly, unlike whole kidney lysates, no GSDMD-protein expression was detectable in isolated kidney tubules. In IRI and cisplatin-induced AKI, GSDMD-deficient mice exhibited hypersensitivity to injury as assessed by tubular damage, elevated markers of serum urea, and serum creatinine. This hypersensitivity was reversed by a combined deficiency of GSDMD and the necroptosis mediator mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL). In conclusion, we demonstrate a non-cell autonomous role for GSDMD in protecting the tubular compartment from necroptosis-mediated damage in IRI.",

      "abstractNote": "In clinical psychology, imagery rescripting (ImRs) is a promising intervention to target negative emotional memories after victimization experiences. The present research tested the effects of ImRs in \"minor\" cases of experienced injustice. After imagining being the victim of an injustice, participants (N = 272) were randomly assigned to one of four conditions in a univariate design (treatment: active ImRs, passive ImRs; control: pleasant imagery, imagery rehearsal). Dependent variables were positive and negative affect; mediator variables were justice-related satisfaction and empowerment. Both justice-related satisfaction and empowerment increased positive and decreased negative affect, but empowerment was higher in the active than in the passive ImRs condition (while justice-related satisfaction was increased by both ImRs conditions). These results suggest that ImRs can be beneficial even in minor victimization experiences and that these beneficial effects are mediated by both empowerment and justice-related satisfaction.",

      "title": "Over-optimism in unsupervised microbiome analysis: Insights from network learning and clustering",
      "abstractNote": "In recent years, unsupervised analysis of microbiome data, such as microbial network analysis and clustering, has increased in popularity. Many new statistical and computational methods have been proposed for these tasks. This multiplicity of analysis strategies poses a challenge for researchers, who are often unsure which method(s) to use and might be tempted to try different methods on their dataset to look for the \"best\" ones. However, if only the best results are selectively reported, this may cause over-optimism: the \"best\" method is overly fitted to the specific dataset, and the results might be non-replicable on validation data. Such effects will ultimately hinder research progress. Yet so far, these topics have been given little attention in the context of unsupervised microbiome analysis. In our illustrative study, we aim to quantify over-optimism effects in this context. We model the approach of a hypothetical microbiome researcher who undertakes four unsupervised research tasks: clustering of bacterial genera, hub detection in microbial networks, differential microbial network analysis, and clustering of samples. While these tasks are unsupervised, the researcher might still have certain expectations as to what constitutes interesting results. We translate these expectations into concrete evaluation criteria that the hypothetical researcher might want to optimize. We then randomly split an exemplary dataset from the American Gut Project into discovery and validation sets multiple times. For each research task, multiple method combinations (e.g., methods for data normalization, network generation, and/or clustering) are tried on the discovery data, and the combination that yields the best result according to the evaluation criterion is chosen. While the hypothetical researcher might only report this result, we also apply the \"best\" method combination to the validation dataset. The results are then compared between discovery and validation data. In all four research tasks, there are notable over-optimism effects; the results on the validation data set are worse compared to the discovery data, averaged over multiple random splits into discovery/validation data. Our study thus highlights the importance of validation and replication in microbiome analysis to obtain reliable results and demonstrates that the issue of over-optimism goes beyond the context of statistical testing and fishing for significance.\nAuthor summaryMicrobiome research focuses on communities of microbes, for example, those living in the human gut. To identify the structure of such communities, constructing microbial networks that represent associations between different microbes has become popular. The microbial associations are often further analyzed by applying cluster algorithms, i.e., researchers try to find groups (clusters) of microbes that are strongly associated with each other. Likewise, researchers are also interested in finding clusters of samples that are similar in bacterial compositions, often referred to as enterotypes. To produce broader and more reliable insights, networks and clustering results that have been constructed based on one specific dataset should generalize to other datasets as well. However, this may be compromised by the large number of statistical methods available for network learning and clustering. Due to uncertainty about which method to use, researchers might try multiple approaches on their dataset and pick the method which yields the \"best\" result (e.g., the network that has the highest number of strongly connected microbes). When many such methods are tried, the \"best\" method may be overly fitted to the specific dataset at hand, and the result may not generalize to new data. Our study demonstrates such over-optimism effects and gives recommendations for detecting and/or avoiding over-optimistic bias. We aim to generate greater awareness around this issue and to increase reliability of future microbiome studies.",

      "title": "Over-optimistic evaluation and reporting of novel cluster algorithms: an illustrative study",
      "abstractNote": "When researchers publish new cluster algorithms, they usually demonstrate the strengths of their novel approaches by comparing the algorithms' performance with existing competitors. However, such studies are likely to be optimistically biased towards the new algorithms, as the authors have a vested interest in presenting their method as favorably as possible in order to increase their chances of getting published. Therefore, the superior performance of newly introduced cluster algorithms is over-optimistic and might not be confirmed in independent benchmark studies performed by neutral and unbiased authors. This problem is known among many researchers, but so far, the different mechanisms leading to over-optimism in cluster algorithm evaluation have never been systematically studied and discussed. Researchers are thus often not aware of the full extent of the problem. We present an illustrative study to illuminate the mechanisms by which authors-consciously or unconsciously-paint their cluster algorithm's performance in an over-optimistic light. Using the recently published cluster algorithm Rock as an example, we demonstrate how optimization of the used datasets or data characteristics, of the algorithm's parameters and of the choice of the competing cluster algorithms leads to Rock's performance appearing better than it actually is. Our study is thus a cautionary tale that illustrates how easy it can be for researchers to claim apparent \"superiority\" of a new cluster algorithm. This illuminates the vital importance of strategies for avoiding the problems of over-optimism (such as, e.g., neutral benchmark studies), which we also discuss in the article.",

      "title": "Validation of cluster analysis results on validation data: A systematic framework",
      "abstractNote": "Cluster analysis refers to a wide range of data analytic techniques for class discovery and is popular in many application fields. To assess the quality of a clustering result, different cluster validation procedures have been proposed in the literature. While there is extensive work on classical validation techniques, such as internal and external validation, less attention has been given to validating and replicating a clustering result using a validation dataset. Such a dataset may be part of the original dataset, which is separated before analysis begins, or it could be an independently collected dataset. We present a systematic, structured review of the existing literature about this topic. For this purpose, we outline a formal framework that covers most existing approaches for validating clustering results on validation data. In particular, we review classical validation techniques such as internal and external validation, stability analysis, and visual validation, and show how they can be interpreted in terms of our framework. We define and formalize different types of validation of clustering results on a validation dataset, and give examples of how clustering studies from the applied literature that used a validation dataset can be seen as instances of our framework.

      "abstractNote": "Background Acute kidney injury (AKI) is an often neglected but crucial element of clinical nephrology. The aim of the Nephrology and Public Policy Committee (NPPC) of the European Renal Association-European Dialysis and Transplant Association is to promote several key aspects of European nephrology. One of the targets proposed by the NPPC was to advance European nephrology involvement in AKI. Methods We undertook a literature analysis to define the current position of European nephrology in the field of AKI compared with other regions and to determine how different European countries compare with each other. Results It appeared that vis-a-vis countries with a comparable socio-economic status (the USA, Australia, New Zealand and Canada), the European contribution was almost 50% less. Within Europe, Central and Eastern Europe and countries with a lower gross domestic product showed lower scientific output. Nephrologists contributed to less than half of the output. There was no trend of a change over the last decade. Conclusions There is room to improve the contribution of European nephrology in the field of AKI. We propose a model on how to promote clinical collaboration on AKI across Europe and the creation of a pan-European nephrology network of interested units to improve clinical outcomes, increase nephrologist involvement and awareness outside nephrology and stimulate research on AKI in Europe. Accordingly, we also propose a list of research priorities and stress the need for more European funding of AKI research.",

      "abstractNote": "To achieve scientific progress in terms of building a cumulative body of knowledge, careful attention to benchmarking is of the utmost importance, requiring that proposals of new methods are extensively and carefully compared with their best predecessors, and existing methods subjected to neutral comparison studies. Answers to benchmarking questions should be evidence-based, with the relevant evidence being collected through well-thought-out procedures, in reproducible and replicable ways. In the present paper, we review good research practices in benchmarking from the perspective of the area of cluster analysis. Discussion is given to the theoretical, conceptual underpinnings of benchmarking based on simulated and empirical data in this context. Subsequently, the practicalities of how to address benchmarking questions in clustering are dealt with, and foundational recommendations are made based on existing literature.This article is categorized under:Fundamental Concepts of Data and Knowledge > Data ConceptsFundamental Concepts of Data and Knowledge > Key Design Issues in Data MiningTechnologies > Structure Discovery and Clustering",

      "abstractNote": "The medical field has seen a rapid increase in the development of artificial intelligence (AI)-based prediction models. With the introduction of such AI-based prediction model tools and software in cardiovascular patient care, the cardiovascular researcher and healthcare professional are challenged to understand the opportunities as well as the limitations of the AI-based predictions. In this article, we present 12 critical questions for cardiovascular health professionals to ask when confronted with an AI-based prediction model. We aim to support medical professionals to distinguish the AI-based prediction models that can add value to patient care from the AI that does not.",

      "abstractNote": "Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA)-associated vasculitides (AAV) are characterized by inflammation of small-to-medium-sized blood vessels and the presence of autoantibodies against cytoplasmic proteases sited in neutrophils and monocytes. Increasing evidence indicates a substantial role of monocytes and macrophages in the pathogenesis of AAV. Activated monocytes and macrophages contribute to necroinflammation in peripheral vasculitic lesions as well as to central and peripheral mechanisms of autoimmunity. The intermediate monocyte subset (CD14(++)CD16(+)) is increased and monocytes show elevated expression of CD14, Toll-like receptor 2/4, MHCII and integrins, likely reflecting activation and increased monocyte extravasation. Monocytes differentiate locally predominantly into alternatively activated (M2) macrophages, which are known for cell-clearance and phagocytosis, but may ultimately lead to fibrosis. Phagocytotic function of macrophages can be impaired by surface expression of cytoplasmic proteases on apoptotic neutrophils and causes release of inflammatory cytokines and immunogenic contents, presumably resulting in a vicious circle of increased neutrophil, T and B cell activation and consequent ANCA production. Considering their crucial role in initiating necroinflammation as well as fibrogenesis, monocytes and macrophages may represent a logic first-line target for new treatment options in AAV.",

      "abstractNote": "BackgroundOmics data can be very informative in survival analysis and may improve the prognostic ability of classical models based on clinical risk factors for various diseases, for example breast cancer. Recent research has focused on integrating omics and clinical data, yet has often ignored the need for appropriate model building for clinical variables. Medical literature on classical prognostic scores, as well as biostatistical literature on appropriate model selection strategies for low dimensional (clinical) data, are often ignored in the context of omics research. The goal of this paper is to fill this methodological gap by investigating the added predictive value of gene expression data for models using varying amounts of clinical information.MethodsWe analyze two data sets from the field of survival prognosis of breast cancer patients. First, we construct several proportional hazards prediction models using varying amounts of clinical information based on established medical knowledge. These models are then used as a starting point (i.e. included as a clinical offset) for identifying informative gene expression variables using resampling procedures and penalized regression approaches (model based boosting and the LASSO). In order to assess the added predictive value of the gene signatures, measures of prediction accuracy and separation are examined on a validation data set for the clinical models and the models that combine the two sources of information.ResultsFor one data set, we do not find any substantial added predictive value of the omics data when compared to clinical models. On the second data set, we identify a noticeable added predictive value, however only for scenarios where little or no clinical information is included in the modeling process. We find that including more clinical information can lead to a smaller number of selected omics predictors.ConclusionsNew research using omics data should include all available established medical knowledge in order to allow an adequate evaluation of the added predictive value of omics data. Including all relevant clinical information in the analysis might also lead to more parsimonious models. The developed procedure to assess the predictive value of the omics data can be readily applied to other scenarios.",

      "abstractNote": "In computational biology and other sciences, researchers are frequently faced with a choice between several computational methods for performing data analyses. Benchmarking studies aim to rigorously compare the performance of different methods using well-characterized benchmark datasets, to determine the strengths of each method or to provide recommendations regarding suitable choices of methods for an analysis. However, benchmarking studies must be carefully designed and implemented to provide accurate, unbiased, and informative results. Here, we summarize key practical guidelines and recommendations for performing high-quality benchmarking analyses, based on our experiences in computational biology.",

      "title": "Refractory lupus nephritis: a survey",
      "abstractNote": "'Refractory lupus nephritis' is a frequently used term but poorly defined. We conducted a survey among nephrologists and rheumatologists to spot the diversity of perceptions of this term and to better understand the clinical practice related to 'refractory lupus nephritis'. A total of 145 questionnaires completed by lupus nephritis experts were available for analysis, of which 52% were nephrologists, 34% rheumatologists, and 13% internists. Response to induction treatment was mostly assessed after six months (58%), but assessment at three months was more common with the use of the EURO lupus protocol than with other treatment protocols. Rheumatologists used urinary sediment to assess response more frequently than nephrologists (66 vs. 48%, p < 0.05, Chi(2)), while nephrologists conversely relied significantly more on clinical symptoms (61 vs. 31%, p < 0.0001, Chi(2)). Non-nephrologists quantified proteinuria preferentially by 24 h urine sampling, while the majority of nephrologists relied on the urinary protein/creatinine ratio (UPCR) or the albumin/creatinine ratio of spot urine samples (59 vs. 38%, p < 0.05, Chi(2)). A total of 91% were concerned about persistent immunological systemic lupus erythematosus activity. There was less concern about drug adherence, renal scarring, genetic factors or other kidney diseases. Less than 20% check for drug adherence by regularly monitoring drug plasma levels. Nephrologists considered a re-biopsy more often than rheumatologists (58 vs. 38%, p < 0.05, Chi(2)). Together, among lupus nephritis experts there is considerable diversity in the perception of what the term 'refractory lupus nephritis' describes and how it is defined. A consensus definition of 'refractory lupus nephritis' is needed.",

      "abstractNote": "The proteasome is essential for the selective degradation of most cellular proteins and is fine-tuned according to cellular needs. Proteasome activators serve as building blocks to adjust protein turnover in cell growth and differentiation. Understanding the cellular function of proteasome activation in more detail offers a new strategy for therapeutic targeting of proteasomal protein breakdown in disease. The role of the proteasome activator PA200 in cell function and its regulation in disease is unknown. In this study, we investigated the function of PA200 in myofibroblast differentiation and fibrotic tissue remodeling. PA200 was upregulated in hyperplastic basal cells and myofibroblasts of fibrotic lungs from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Increased expression of PA200 and enhanced formation of PA200-proteasome complexes was also evident in experimental fibrosis of the lung and kidney in vivo and in activated primary human myofibroblasts of the lung in vitro. Transient silencing and overexpression revealed that PA200 functions as a negative regulator of myofibroblast differentiation of human but not mouse cells. Our data thus suggest an unexpected and important role for PA200 in adjusting myofibroblast activation in response to pro-fibrotic stimuli, which fails in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.",

      "title": "The predictive power of insomnia symptoms on other aspects of mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic: a longitudinal study",
      "abstractNote": "Symptoms of insomnia are an important risk factor for the development of mental disorders, especially during stressful life periods such as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. However, up to now, most studies have used cross-sectional data, and the prolonged impact of insomnia symptoms during the pandemic on later mental health remains unclear. Therefore, we investigated insomnia symptoms as a predictor of other aspects of mental health across 6 months, with altogether seven assessments (every 30 days, t0-t6), in a community sample (N = 166-267). Results showed no mean-level increase of insomnia symptoms and/or deterioration of mental health between baseline assessment (t0) and the 6- month follow-up (t6). As preregistered, higher insomnia symptoms (between persons) across all time points predicted reduced mental health at the 6-month follow-up. Interestingly, contrary to our hypothesis, higher insomnia symptoms at 1 month, within each person (i.e., compared to that person's symptoms at other time points), predicted improved rather than reduced aspects of mental health 1 month later. Hence, we replicated the predictive effect of averagely increased insomnia symptoms on impaired later mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, we were surprised that increased insomnia symptoms at 1 month predicted aspects of improved mental health 1 month later. This unexpected effect might be specific for our study population and a consequence of our study design. Overall, increased insomnia symptoms may have served as a signal to engage in, and successfully implement, targeted countermeasures, which led to better short-term mental health in this healthy sample.",

      "abstractNote": "Recent meta-analyses come to conflicting conclusions about the efficacy of long-term psychoanalytic psychotherapy (LTPP). Our first goal was to reproduce the most recent meta-analysis by Leichsenring, Abbass, Luyten, Hilsenroth, and Rabung (2013) who found evidence for the efficacy of LTPP in the treatment of complex mental disorders. Our replicated effect sizes were in general slightly smaller. Second, we conducted an updated meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials comparing LTPP (lasting for at least 1 year and 40 sessions) to other forms of psychotherapy in the treatment of complex mental disorders. We focused on a transparent research process according to open science standards and applied a series of elaborated meta-analytic procedures to test and control for publication bias. Our updated meta-analysis comprising 191 effect sizes from 14 eligible studies revealed small, statistically significant effect sizes at post-treatment for the outcome domains psychiatric symptoms, target problems, social functioning, and overall effectiveness (Hedges' g ranging between 0.24 and 0.35). The effect size for the domain personality functioning (0.24) was not significant (p = .08). No signs for publication bias could be detected. In light of a heterogeneous study set and some methodological shortcomings in the primary studies, these results should be interpreted cautiously. In conclusion, LTPP might be superior to other forms of psychotherapy in the treatment of complex mental disorders. Notably, our effect sizes represent the additional gain of LTPP versus other forms of primarily long-term psychotherapy. In this case, large differences in effect sizes are not to be expected.",

      "abstractNote": "Systemic lupus erythematosus is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by loss of tolerance against nuclear and cytoplasmic self-antigens, induction of immunity and tissue inflammation. Lupus nephritis (LN), the most important predictor of morbidity in SLE, develops in almost 30% of SLE patients at disease onset and in up to 5060% within the first 10 years. Firstly, in this review, we put the pathogenic mechanisms of the disease into a conceptual frame, giving emphasis to the role of the innate immune system in this loss of self-tolerance and the induction of the adaptive immune response. In this aspect, many mechanisms have been described such as dysregulation and acceleration of cell-death pathways, an aberrant clearance and overload of immunogenic acidnucleic-containing debris and IC, and the involvement of antigen-presenting cells and other innate immune cells in the induction of this adaptive immune response. This result in a clonal expansion of autoreactive lymphocytes with generation of effector T-cells, memory B-cells and plasma cells that produce autoantibodies that will cause kidney damage. Secondly, we review the immunological pathways of damage in the kidney parenchyma, initiated by autoantibody binding and immune complex deposition, and followed by complement-mediated microvascular injury, activation of kidney stromal cells and the recruitment of leukocytes. Finally, we summarize the rationale for the treatment of LN, from conventional to new targeted therapies, focusing on their systemic immunologic effects and the minimization of podocytary damage.",

      "abstractNote": "Kidney cholesterol crystal embolism (CCE) occurs in advanced atherosclerosis and induces a thrombotic (micro) angiopathy, a drop in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and an ischemic kidney infarction with necroinflammation. We speculated that common metabolic comorbidities such as diabetes or hyperuricemia would independently modulate each of these distinct pathophysiological processes. To test this, experimental CCE was induced by injecting cholesterol crystals into the left kidney artery of mice and thrombotic angiopathy, GFR drop, and infarct size were analyzed after 24 hours in the presence of hyperglycemia (about 500 mg/dL) or hyperuricemia (about 8 mg/dL) or their absence. In healthy mice, unilateral CCE caused diffuse thrombotic angiopathy in interlobar, arcuate and interlobular arteries, followed by a 50% or less drop in GFR compared to baseline and a variable degree of ischemic kidney necrosis. Hyperglycemia but not hyperuricemia aggravated thrombotic angiopathy although both caused a GFR decline, albeit via different mechanisms. Hyperglycemia aggravated GFR loss by increasing necroinflammation and infarct size, while the antioxidative effects of hyperuricemia reasonably attenuated necroinflammation and infarct size but induced a diffuse vasoconstriction in affected and unaffected kidney tissue. Thus, both hyperglycemia or hyperuricemia opposite effects on ischemic necroinflammation and infarction.@Copyright 2023, International Society of Nephrology. Published by Elsevier Inc.

      "abstractNote": "Background Late diagnosis is a hurdle for treatment of AKI, but targeting AKI-CKD transition may improve outcomes. High mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) is a nuclear regulator of transcription and a driver of necroinflammation in AKI. We hypothesized that HMGB1 would also modulate AKI-CKD transition in other ways.Methods We conducted single-cell transcriptome analysis of human and mouse AKI and mouse in vivo and in vitro studies with tubular cell-specific depletion of Hmgb1 and HMGB1 antagonists.Results HMGB1 was ubiquitously expressed in kidney cells. Preemptive HMGB1 antagonism with glycyrrhizic acid (Gly) and ethyl pyruvate (EP) did not affect postischemic AKI but attenuated AKI-CKD transition in a model of persistent kidney hypoxia. Consistently, tubular Hmgb1 depletion in Pax8 rtTA, TetO Cre, Hmgb1(fl/fl )mice did not protect from AKI, but from AKI-CKD transition. In vitro studies confirmed that absence of HMGB1 or HMGB1 inhibition with Gly and EP does not affect ischemic necrosis of growth arrested differentiated tubular cells but increased the resilience of cycling tubular cells that survived the acute injury to oxidative stress. This effect persisted when neutralizing extracellular HMGB1 with 2G7. Consistently, late-onset HMGB1 blockade with EP started after the peak of ischemic AKI in mice prevented AKI-CKD transition, even when 2G7 blocked extracellular HMGB1.Conclusion Treatment of AKI could become feasible when (1) focusing on long-term outcomes of AKI; (2) targeting AKI-CKD transition with drugs initiated after the AKI peak; and (3) targeting with drugs that block HMGB1 in intracellular and extracellular compartments.",

      "abstractNote": "Background Dual inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plus sodium-glucose transporter (SGLT)-2 or the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) demonstrated additive renoprotective effects in large clinical trials. We hypothesized that triple therapy with RAS/SGLT2/MR inhibitors would be superior to dual RAS/SGLT2 blockade in attenuating CKD progression.Methods We performed a preclinical randomized controlled trial (PCTE0000266) in Col4a3-deficient mice with established Alport nephropathy. Treatment was initiated late (age 6 weeks) in mice with elevated serum creatinine and albuminuria and with glomerulosclerosis, interstitial fibrosis, and tubular atrophy. We block-randomized 40 male and 40 female mice to either nil (vehicle) or late-onset food admixes of ramipril monotherapy (10 mg/kg), ramipril plus empagliflozin (30 mg/kg), or ramipril plus empagliflozin plus finerenone (10 mg/kg). Primary end point was mean survival.Results Mean survival was 63.7 +/- 10.0 days (vehicle), 77.3 +/- 5.3 days (ramipril), 80.3 +/- 11.0 days (dual), and 103.1 +/- 20.3 days (triple). Sex did not affect outcome. Histopathology, pathomics, and RNA sequencing revealed that finerenone mainly suppressed the residual interstitial inflammation and fibrosis despite dual RAS/SGLT2 inhibition.Conclusion Experiments in mice suggest that triple RAS/SGLT2/MR blockade may substantially improve renal outcomes in Alport syndrome and possibly other progressive CKDs because of synergistic effects on the glomerular and tubulointerstitial compartments.",

      "title": "Prediction of Male Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting Outcomes Using Body Surface Area Weighted Left Ventricular End-diastolic Diameter: Multicenter Retrospective Cohort Study",
      "abstractNote": "Background: The presence of a high left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD) has been linked to a less favorable outcome in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) procedures. However, by taking into consideration the reference of left ventricular size and volume measurements relative to the patient's body surface area (BSA), it has been suggested that the accuracy of the predicting outcomes may be improved.\nObjective: We propose that BSA weighted LVEDD (bLVEDD) is a more accurate predictor of outcomes in patients undergoing CABG compared to simply using LVEDD alone.\nMethods: This study was a comprehensive retrospective cohort study that was conducted across multiple medical centers. The inclusion criteria for this study were patients who were admitted for treatment between October 2016 and May 2021. Only elective surgery patients were included in the study, while those undergoing emergency surgery were not considered. All participants in the study received standard care, and their clinical data were collected through the institutional registry in accordance with the guidelines set forth by the Society of Thoracic Surgeons National Adult Cardiac Database. bLVEDD was defined as LVEDD divided by BSA. The primary outcome was in-hospital all-cause mortality (30 days), and the secondary outcomes were postoperative severe adverse events, including use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, multiorgan failure, use of intra-aortic balloon pump, postoperative stroke, and postoperative myocardial infarction.\nResults: In total, 9474 patients from 5 centers under the Chinese Cardiac Surgery Registry were eligible for analysis. We found that a high LVEDD was a negative factor for male patients' mortality (odds ratio 1.44, P<.001) and secondary outcomes. For female patients, LVEDD was associated with secondary outcomes but did not reach statistical differences for morality. bLVEDD showed a strong association with postsurgery mortality (odds ratio 2.70, P<.001), and secondary outcomes changed in parallel with bLVEDD in male patients. However, bLVEDD did not reach statistical differences when fitting either mortality or severer outcomes in female patients. In male patients, the categorical bLVEDD showed high power to predict mortality (area under the curve [AUC] 0.71, P<.001) while BSA (AUC 0.62) and LVEDD (AUC 0.64) both contributed to the risk of mortality but were not as significant as bLVEDD (P<.001).\nConclusions: bLVEDD is an important predictor for male mortality in CABG, removing the bias of BSA and showing a strong capability to accurately predict mortality outcomes.\nTrial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02400125; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02400125 (Interact J Med Res 2023;12:e45898) doi: 10.2196/45898",

      "abstractNote": "Medical societies have a social responsibility to disseminate knowledge and inform health authorities on threats to public health posed by various diseases. Advocacy for health protection programmes and for medical research funding is now embedded into the missions of most scientific societies. To promote kidney research funding in Europe, the European Renal Association - European Dialysis and Transplant Association (ERA-EDTA), rather than acting as an individual society advocating for the fight against kidney disease, has actively helped to create an alliance of national associations centred on kidney diseases, the European Kidney Health Alliance (EKHA), and joined the Biomedical Alliance (BMA). The ERA-EDTA is fully committed to supporting its working groups (WGs) and consortia of its members to allow them to produce valuable kidney research. The framing and formalization of projects, and the regulatory issues related to submission to the European Commission, are complex. To help WGs to gain expert advice from agencies with specific know-how, the ERA-EDTA has adopted a competitive approach. The best research projects proposed by WGs and consortia of other European investigators will receive seed funding to cover the costs of consultancy by expert agencies. Via its broader platforms, the EKHA and the BMA, the ERA-EDTA will strive towards broader recognition of kidney disease and related clusters of non-communicable diseases, by European and national agencies, as major threats to the qualities of life of their populations and their economies.",

      "abstractNote": "Relationship satisfaction can be assessed in retrospection, as a global evaluation, or as a momentary state. In two experience sampling studies (N = 130, N = 510) the specificities of these assessment modalities are examined. We show that 1) compared to other summary statistics like the median, the mean of relationship satisfaction states describes retrospective and global evaluations best (but the difference to some other summary statistics was negligible); 2) retrospection introduces an overestimation of the average annoyance in the relationship reported on a momentary basis, which results in an overall negative mean-level bias for retrospective relationship satisfaction; 3) this bias is most strongly moderated by global relationship satisfaction at the time of retrospection; 4) snapshots of momentary relationship satisfaction get representative of global evaluations after approximately two weeks of sampling. The findings extend the recall bias reported in the literature for retrospection of negative affect to the domain of relationship evaluations and assist researchers in designing efficient experience sampling studies.",
