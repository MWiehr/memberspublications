# memberspublications

This is the github repo for the LMU Open Science Centers Members Publications list. 
It is used to convert zotero (https://www.zotero.org/groups/5213376/lmuopensciencecenter_memberspublications) files to a word document.
For that it uses the better bib tex application to automatically update the data sets LMUOpenScienceCenter_MembersPublications (still need to manually push them as they only update on the personal device).
For future updates keep in mind to not override the data on the shared zotero folder. The Tags manually added there may not be persistent and could be overridden
